# TIMETRVLR

Textual & Iconographic Mapping for Exploration, Transcription, Retrieval, Visualization, and Linguistic Reconstructions

The goal of TIMETRVLR is to make large-scale digitized archives more accessible, by combining computer vision, natural language processing, and navigational interfaces to guide users through time, images, and text.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
