      "|erdx3dsj|the Council of the Sydenham Society did me the honour of appointing me to edit certain reprints of monographs on Diseases of Women, I certainly expected to be able to pre- sent the members of the Society with a greater variety of subjects. On careful examination, I found a considerable number of interesting cases recorded ; but extremely few papers of a suf- ficient length and importance to justify their republication. Until the latter half of the last century there was no book on Diseases of Women of any scientific pretension, and we cannot, therefore, wonder that monographs were scarce. Since that time the subject has obtained due attention, and now it is not behind any other department, in the importance attached to it, the value of the works illustrating it, and the scientific character of the practitioners pursuing it. I have, however, found a few papers of great value, which I have selected, and to which I have appended notes, embodying whatever information has been laid before |1          |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|of the practitioners pursuing it. I have, however, found a few papers of great value, which I have selected, and to which I have appended notes, embodying whatever information has been laid before the profession since their authors' time. The greater part of the volume is occupied by tracts on Puerperal Fever, which has a just claim on our attention, on account of its serious importance. I have as far as possible selected those which give us the experience of the writer in some particular epidemic, and I have purposely included those whose descriptions and opinions differ, in order that the reader may have a practical illustration of the variation of the disease in different epidemics. A.a was to be expected, in the midst of much that is ex- tremely valuable, we find much that we now believe to be erroneous, both physiologically and pathologically, in the earlier writings. Whenever these errors have a practical bearing, 1 have felt it right to point them out in a note; but as a       |2          |1629        |\n",

Whenever these errors have a practical bearing, 1 have felt it right to point them out in a note; but as a general rule this did not seem necessary, and I have rather avoided distracting the reader's attention by my comments. Each successive treatise will be found to contain fewer of these hypothetical statements, and to be more strictly confined within the domain of experience. I have thought it might be useful to prefix to these tracts a short historical sketch of the principal epidemics. I have collected, with some labour, all the information within my reach, and I trust that the summary will be found tolerably complete. I should feel some apology necessary for my own share in this Volume, which has been prepared under the pressure of many engagements, were it not for the great intrinsic value that such a collection of original writings, by men of great experience, must ever possess. 137,    |3          |1629        |\n",

      "|erdx3dsj|Peterculter in tberdecnihirt \" PUERPERAL FEYER. AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE EPIDEMICS OE PUERPERAL EEVER. BY THE EDITOR. There are few diseases so fraught with associations of dis- tress as Puerperal Fever when it prevails epidemically. The course of a favorable convalescence after parturition suddenly interrupted, and without any appreciable cause, exchanged for symptoms which excite the utmost alarm in the physician : the anxiety and anguish of those so lately rejoicing, the blighting of the sweetest hopes in life, and finally the rupture of its dearest ties, and the melancholy desolation of a home but lately the abode of happiness. This is but a slight sketch of the picture which presents itself to the mind when this fearful disease is mentionedâa picture whose gloom is heightened by the inutility of all pre- cautions to guard against its attacks, and, in the majority of cases, the utter failure of all attempts to arrest its progress or to prevent its fatal termination.

      "|erdx3dsj|the inutility of all pre- cautions to guard against its attacks, and, in the majority of cases, the utter failure of all attempts to arrest its progress or to prevent its fatal termination. Impelled by such feelings, the result of sad experience, I have resolved to present to the reader a selection of such works on the subject as, in my judgment, is best calculated to afford a complete view of the disease in itself, and especially of the aspect it presents when it occurs epidemically; and not only so, but by selecting descriptions of the epidemics of England, Ireland, and Scotland,âthe general characters of the disease, and its particular modifications, will be illustrated by those who witnessed them. I have thought that it might also be useful to prefix a short sketch of the principal epidemics of puerperal fever, with their peculiar characteristics as described by the authors who have a treatise upon puerperal fever, nor yet to enter very minutely into each epidemic ; but simply  |10         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|epidemics of puerperal fever, with their peculiar characteristics as described by the authors who have a treatise upon puerperal fever, nor yet to enter very minutely into each epidemic ; but simply to trace their succession, to indicate their Leading peculiarities, and to draw some conclu- sions from the entire collection of facts. That women in childbed arc liable to attacks of a febrile disease, which often proves fatal, has been observed by the earliest writers, and attributed by them to various causes. Dr, Hiiliue has given a quotation from Hippocrates with a trans- lation, which refers certainly to puerperal fever, and which both Hippocrates and Avicenna attribute to obstruction of the lochia. \" Plater (1602) considers it to be an inflammation of the uterus; Sennert (1656) describes it very well, and recommends bleed- ing; he and Kiverius (1674) believe it to arise from suppression of the lochia; Sylvius (1674) from a deficiency of the lochia. Willis (1682) observes that the    |11         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|it very well, and recommends bleed- ing; he and Kiverius (1674) believe it to arise from suppression of the lochia; Sylvius (1674) from a deficiency of the lochia. Willis (1682) observes that the fevers of lying-in women are attended with much more danger than those which happen in common, and that they differ very materially, both from a simple and putrid synochus. The antecedent causes of these fevers he supposes, with Scnncrtus and Kiverius, to be a de- praved disposition of the blood from the long suppression of the menstrual flux during pregnancy, or from some evil affec- tion of the uterus after childbirth.\"1 Similar allusions to the disease arc to be found in the earlier writers of these countries and on the Continent. Thomas llaynaldc, in his translation of Eucharius Rhodion,9 says, \" It i^ also to be understood that many times after the deliverance, happeneth to women either the fever or ague, or inflammation of the body ; cither trembling in the belly or else commotion ; or |12         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|\" It i^ also to be understood that many times after the deliverance, happeneth to women either the fever or ague, or inflammation of the body ; cither trembling in the belly or else commotion ; or setting out of order of the mother or matrix.\" In the 'Childbearor's Cabinet' (1653) wc have directions how to \"help the wringing and pressings of the belly in childbed women by outward and inward means, and by drinks.\" Then by degrees each author gives a more definite shape to his ac- count of the disease, and sounder directions for its treatment, mosl regarding the disease as inflammation of the womb, the result of suppressed lochia. 1 may refer the reader who is anxious to Investigate the subject, to the works of Strother Kulme \"ii Puerperal Peter, p. B8 ei teq. Birth of Mankinde, p. 120 (1718), Cooper (1725), Sydenham (1726), Boerhaave (1737), Hoffmann (1734), Mauriceau, Peu, &c. &c.

      "|erdx3dsj|Cooper (1725), Sydenham (1726), Boerhaave (1737), Hoffmann (1734), Mauriceau, Peu, &c. &c. Dr. Hnlme states that Strother, in his ' Critikon Febrium/ is the first writer he has met with who gives it the name of puerperal fever. These details will be sufficient to show that the older autho- rities were acquainted with the disease in question, that in their practice they met with puerperal fever sporadically as we do; but we have no evidence of their having witnessed an epidemic, or that they were acquainted with the occa- sional extensive prevalence and alarming mortality of the disease. The only allusion which may be thus interpreted (so far as my researches extend), is by M. Peu, who states that in 1664 \"a prodigious number\" of women died in the Hotel-Dieu of Paris after their confinement. They were attacked with hemorrhage, and after death, the bodies being examined, were found \" full of abscesses/-' It was attributed to impure air from a ward filled with wounded, which was situated|14         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|They were attacked with hemorrhage, and after death, the bodies being examined, were found \" full of abscesses/-' It was attributed to impure air from a ward filled with wounded, which was situated underneath the lying-in ward.1 The first undoubted epidemic of puerperal fever on record, I believe, is that which prevailed in Paris during the winter of 1746. It was extremely fatal, attacking the poor, and proving much more fatal to those in hospital than to those who were de- livered at their own houses. Of twenty women confined in Fe- bruary of that year in the Hotel-Dieu, scarcely one recovered; they died between the fifth and the seventeenth day after their confinement.2 M. Malouin has given the following account of the symptoms and progress of this epidemic :âaThe disease usually commenced with a diarrhoea; the uterus became dry, hard, and painful j it was swollen, and the lochia had not their ordinary course ; then the woman experienced pain in the bowels, particularly in the    |15         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|with a diarrhoea; the uterus became dry, hard, and painful j it was swollen, and the lochia had not their ordinary course ; then the woman experienced pain in the bowels, particularly in the situation of the broad ligaments ; the abdomen was tense; and to all these symptoms were some- times joined pain of the head, and sometimes cough. On the third or fourth day after delivery, the mammae became flaccid. On opening the bodies, curdled milk was found on the surface of the intestines, a milky serous fluid in the hypogastrium ; a similar fluid was found in the thorax of certain women, and 1 Pratique des Accouch.. p. 268. - Mem. de I'Acad. des Sciences. 171 *i. when the Lungs were divided, they discharged a milky or putrid lymph. The stomach, the intestines, and the uterus, when carefully examined, appeared to have been inflamed. According to the report of the physicians, there escaped clots on opening the vessels of this organ.\"1 Jussieu has also described this epidemic of 17 10;        |16         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|examined, appeared to have been inflamed. According to the report of the physicians, there escaped clots on opening the vessels of this organ.\"1 Jussieu has also described this epidemic of 17 10; inflamma- tion of the Btomach, intestines, and uterus was observed, with suppuration of the ovaries. In 1750 an epidemic of puerperal fever again appeared at Lyons and at Paris. In the latter city, according to Poteau, it was characterised by severe1 abdominal pain and tumefaction of the hypo^astrium. On examination, the uterus was found enlarged, its internal membrane soft and black, and its parietes of a livid red colour and gangrenous. I do not know whether the disease was epidemic in France before the establishment of lying-in hospitals or of Lying-in wards in the hospitals; the first example we have seen was in the lying-in ward of the IIotel-Dieu; and in Britain the first re- corded, was about eleven years after the institution of Lying-in hospitals in England, viz., in 1760. From the  |17         |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|we have seen was in the lying-in ward of the IIotel-Dieu; and in Britain the first re- corded, was about eleven years after the institution of Lying-in hospitals in England, viz., in 1760. From the 1.2th of June to the latter end of December of that year, twenty-four women died of puerperal fever in the British Lying-in Hospital.2 Nor was the next year less fatal to lying-in women, for Mr. White states : \" A gentleman, whose veracity I can depend on, informs me that he attended a small private Lying-in hos- pital in London in the latter end of May, June, and the be- ginning of July, 1761, during which time the puerperal fever was very fatal there ; that to the best of his recollection they lost about twenty patients in the month of June j that during this month he himself delivered six women in a short time in the hospital of natural births, and they all died ; he was SO shocked with the loss that he desired the gentleman who had the charge of the hospital to deliver sonic of those   |18         |1629        |\n",

Sometimes also a thick, white, cheesy matter was met with. When the lungs were gorged with blood, or inflamed, or emphysematous, an effusion of serum was found in each side of the chest. We did not observe the hemorrhages which occurred in the epidemic of 1664, and the uterus was not found dry, hard, and tumefied, as in that of 1746. En the epidemic of 1774, the lochia flowed, but they did not flow in 17 Mi.\"1 This valuable description blends together more than one epi- demic; but, as the disease is stated to have presented the same character, 1 have thought it better to quote it in this place. Dr. Gordon mentions that puerperal fever prevailed in Aberdeen in the years 1760-61.9 In the year 1782 the Royal Medical Society of Paris made a report to the French government on M. Doulcet's   |28         |1629        |\n",

Thus my expe- rience agreed in all the principal points with that which had been so forcibly stated to the public by Dr. Armstrong and Mr. Hey.\"1 Dr. Gooch mentions also that puerperal fever was very pre- valent in London and its neighbourhood in the winter of 1824, and again in 1827-28; but these latter epidemics do not seem to have been severe, as the majority were cured by linseed-meal poultices and ipecacuanha. Dr. Gooch quotes Dr. Farre, who states \"that at the east end of London, not far from the river, this disease proved still more fatal during the month of March 1825. One surgeon informed the editor that he had lost seven, another four; in all of which the disease was treated at the instant of its forma- tion by active bloodletting. A physician-accoucheur, who at- tended |49         |1629        |\n",

This plan was pursued for one month, during which not a case of the disease occurred in their practice. The elder practitioner being then sufficiently recovered, returned to his practice, but the first patient he attended was attacked by the disease and died.\"2 I rather think this proves too much; for if we con- clude that the contagion was carried by this gentleman to his patients, we must also admit that the clothes or person may preserve the contagion for a month, and I scarcely think that this would be maintained. In Sunderland, forty out of fifty-three cases occurred in the practice of one surgeon and his assistant. Mr. Roberton, of Manchester, states, that between the 3d of December, |112        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|frequent instances of it from early sitting up after delivery than from all other accidental causes united. Perhaps women arc not so often subject to this fever after laborious births, because of the great care with which they arc then managed; whereas, after easy ones they are more unguarded. The time when the puerperal fever comes on is uncertain. There are not wanting instances where it has been evidently formed before delivery, and at every intermediate time, till five or six weeks afterwards. But the most frequent time of its appearing IS on the third or fourth day after the birth of the child, when the patient is seized with ;i shivering fit, from the violence and duration of which we may generally estimate the danger of the succeeding disease. Before the shivering fit, the patients have often complained of wandering pains in the abdomen, which very soon after become fixed in the hvpogastric region, where a swelling, with exquisite tenderness, ensues. As the disease advances,   |131        |1629        |\n",

Instances have occurred where women have died even within twenty-four hours of the first attack; and I have seen a few who never grew warm after the rigor. In some, death has fol- lowed quite unexpectedly, from the imperceptible but insidious progress of the disease. In other cases, the shivering fit is suc- ceeded with less violent symptoms, but the tenderness and swelling of the abdomen, joined with a fever, are to be esteemed the pathognomonic signs of this disease. It is necessary to enumerate all the symptoms which have been commonly observed, though not in any individual patient, yet cases will occur in practice in which there will be great variation, depending upon the degree of the disease, the constitution of the patient, and the period after delivery when this fever makes its appearance. The pulse has almost invariably an     |134        |1629        |\n",

The pulse has almost invariably an unusual quickness from the beginning. It has often that strength and vibration observed in disorders of the most inflammatory kind, and yet sometimes is exceedingly feeble. The latter is to be reckoned among the most dangerous signs, as it proves that there is a great degree of disease and that the powers of nature are unable to struggle with it. There is, however, much variation in the subsequent stages, but there is scarce a worse omen, than a very weak and accelerated pulse, even though the other Symptoms may seem to be abated. The signs of inflammation continue for a few days till those of putridity appear. The teeth very soon collect a brown ad- hesive sordesj all kinds of food are nauseated, except such as are agreeable from their coldness or sharpness.

We are not to expect that a disease which exhibits such marks of danger should instantly cease; even if a great part of what caused it be removed. We must likewise be careful not to rely so far upon an abate- ment of the symptoms, as wholly to desist from pursuing the method which produced the abatement. For no disease is more liable to returns, which are commonly with increased violence. It must also be observed, that as the certainty of the cure de- pends upon a due repetition of the medicine, the method of giving it at stated hours, without regard to the effect, is not eligible. If a sickness or loathing at the stomach attend it first, this medicine seldom fails to occasion vomiting, and the patient, with a countenance strongly expressive of the benefit she has received, will attest the propriety of our proceeding.

As a supporter of the strength, it lias likewise been found of less service than might have been expected, because of the disturbed state of the stomach and bowels, which it tends to increase. But instead of this medicine, I have often given the powder of columbo root, to the quantity of ten grains, every four hours, in a Lightly aromatic draught, or a strong infusion of cha- momile flowers and cloves; and sometimes the following mixture with advantage,especially when the hiccup has been troublesome: R Spir. vitriol, dulc , $ij; Aq. alcxeter. simp., A<]. 111. pp, sim., aa ^iv ; Sacchar. pur. q. s.

Notwithstanding this disease hath been common to lying-in women in all ages, and in all climates, and even been described in the works of the first writer on the art of healing,2 yet being generally looked upon rather as a symptom or consequence of some other disease, than a disease itself, it hath been either entirely overlooked, or only superficially described by the gene- rality of medical writers, insomuch that we have scarcely had a determinate name by which to distinguish it. Most authors have termed it an obstruction or suppression of the lochia ; others, an inflammation of the uterus ; some have called it, the lochial fever ; some, after-pains; and, in the    |176        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|than may at first be imagined, is the ignorance of people in general, and parti- cularly of lying-in women and their attendants, respecting this disease, which causes them either to neglect it, or to mistake it for after-pains, or some colic complaint; and to this 1 ascribe, in some measure, the great fatality attending it, as will be shown more fully hereafter. It is of consequence, therefore, to the community to be perfectly acquainted with the true nature and danger of this disorder, as it occasions the death of the greater part of those who perish in childbed ! Public hospitals, for reception of the sick and hurt, are the grand seminaries of practical knowledge in the art of medicine. The utility of these institutions is so apparent, that they are now universally received all over Europe. Great Britain in particular hath not been behindhand in promoting such humane designs.

      "|erdx3dsj|know, I say, that pain and soreness of the belly, coming on soon after delivery, unless speedily relieved by judicious assistance, will prove mortal in a few days. They should be taught to know, that these com- plaints are attended with a fever, which is called the puerperal fever. I cannot say how it may be with other physicians, but, for my part, I never hear a childbed-woman complain of a pain and tenderness of the abdomen, but I look upon her disorder with as much anxiety and circumspection as if I knew her actually labouring under an inflammation of the bowels, or a hernia with a strangulated gut; and I think it my duty to be as ex- peditious in relieving the one complaint as the other. I have dwelt the Longer on tins head, in order to show the necessity there is in this disease of the physician being made acquainted with its appearance in time, and to apprize the patient and her attendants of tin* great and imminent danger attending a neglect. Lit as, therefore, return to the   |220        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|turbid urine and a slower pulse, the physician may encourage his patient. A fresh flow of the lochia is an eligible sign. If the urine continues crude, and of the same colour as at the beginning of the disorder, it prognosticates ill. Turbid urine, of a clay or yellowish colour, with a thick sediment, tinged with purple or red, is a token of recovery. A cool, soft skin, as of one in health, unless it be joined with other favorable marks, is only a flattering symptom. A frequent discharge, by vomit, during the course of the disease, of a green or black colour, is generally mortal. Death is speedily to be expected when the pulse becomes so quick and weak as scarcely to be numbered, when the patient throws up everything that is given her, when the stools How involuntarily, and a cold, clammy sweat hangs on the extremities. CHAPTER III. OF THE DISSECTIONS. I will make a few general observations by way of preface. At the time of death, or some hours after, the whole abdomen was commonly   |226        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|with such a gangrenous stench as scarcely to be endured. Cam V\".âShe was 33 years of age, and made no complaints before delivery. She was safely brought to-bed, and had an caw labour. This was her seventh or eighth child. The dis- ease began on the third day after childbirth. There was a violent pain and acute soreness all over the abdomen, accom- panied with a lever. Severe1 pains also shot across the region of the stomach, and down through the sides. A perpetual pain affected the head j she had, too, a difficulty in breathing, and a frequent cough. The tongue was dry, and had a brown streak down the middle. She had a purging from the first, which continued till death j and before that fatal period a vomit- ing succeeded, but no hiccough nor subsultus tendinum. Her breath was very fetid, and of so acrid a quality as to cause a sharp discharge from the nostrils, for a week or ten days together, of a person who happened to receive part of it by the nose, as she was attending her. She|242        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|not only in the omentum, but in the lungs, and other viscera; and if too much blood be taken away, it may weaken the patient so much, as to prevent her supporting the other evacuations. And from hence, I imagine, we may account for that contrariety of opinion which we meet with among authors with respect to bleeding in general in the puerperal fever ; some laying it down as absolutely necessary, and others as strongly opposing it. Were I to interpose my opinion in this matter, I would follow the advice of the intelligent Celsus, and not slavishly adhere to either of these tenets; but be, as it were, of a middle opinion, between the opposite extremes.1 I would say that there are some cases where bleeding is very necessary, and others where it is highly improper; and that these will depend upon many contingent circumstances, which can only be rightly understood by the skill and attention of the physician. The best criterion to judge by is the pulse, and period of the disease. If the    |280        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|upon many contingent circumstances, which can only be rightly understood by the skill and attention of the physician. The best criterion to judge by is the pulse, and period of the disease. If the pulse be full, and vibrate strongly against the finger, bleeding is proper at any period, and under any circum- stance, but more particularly so in the beginning. But if the patient hath neglected to call in advice in due time, by mis- taking the disease for after-pains, or any other malady, then let the physician deliberate, and proceed with caution. For though there may be a flattering strength in the pulse, yet a tendency to a gangrene in the omentum, and other viscera, will often follow soon after, and nature will be hurrying on towards a diarrhoea, which seems to be the only way she takes in order to relieve herself from such a terrible disaster. If I must err, therefore, in this case, and who amongst us is free from error ?â\" Est enim haec ars conjecturalis, neque respondet ei       |281        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|sufficient of itself to produce the disease. The predis- posing causes are such as precede, and lead on to the imme- diate ; the occasional are such as succeed and promote the pre- disposing causes: these, being all combined together, form the immediate or proximate cause. The immediate cause, then, of the puerperal fever, is an in- flammation of the intestines and omentum. For the truth of this assertion I appeal to dissections. The chief predisposing cause, as I apprehend, is the pressure of the gravid uterus against the intestines and omentum. The uterus, after impregnation, rises gradually out of the pelvis into the cavity of the abdomen. As it ascends, it carries its burden along with it, which receives a gradual increase in its bulk every day, for the space of nine months, till at last it becomes so large as to distend the abdomen to an amazing degree. The progress of this distension is supposed to be nearly as follows :âIn the space of three months after conception, the      |297        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|is not unfrequentlj so. the danger of a strangulated circulation will be the greater. The general effects of this pressure of the gravid uterus upon the intestines and omentum will be to interrupt the free cir- culation of the blood, particularly in those parts on which it happens to be most prevalent, and to destroy the tone of the blood-vessels. The other parts, more free from this compression, will receive a larger quantity of blood into their vessels than usual, by which means they will be distended, their coats weakened, and the surrounding capillaries filled with half-stagnating fluids, and may become more or less inflamed. The evils attending this pressure must be increased by respiration. The diaphragm, at every full inspiration, will press the intestinal viscera strongly against the distended uterus, and the abdominal muscles will as strongly resist it. Hence all violent exercise or labour, in an advanced state of pregnancy, must be very hurtful. The frequent vomitings which |302        |1629        |\n",
      "|erdx3dsj|blood and juices, will greatly conduce to this disease. Hence breathing a moist or impure air, want of cleanliness, indolence, vexation, intemperance of every kind, great costivencss, hard labour or violent exercise, high-seasoned meats, too much animal food, arc all very powerful predisposing causes. Pregnant women, therefore, should be very careful to avoid all these things as much as possible. Their diet should be plain and simple, with a due mixture of animal and vegetable substances. They should eat plentifully of fruit, and drink mild, cooling, and acescent liquors. If this sort of diet be not sufficient to keep the body gently open, as costivencss is particularly to be avoided, they should take, now and then, a little cream of tartar, lenitive electuary, or magnesia. Their exercise should be regular, but always moderate ; they should carefully guard against violent passions, and all anxious cares ; and to avoid the bad effects of indolence, let them employ themselves in such   |325        |1629        |\n",

The action of the gastric juice in preventing and checking putrefaction has been often directly demonstrated. Indeed, that the secretions which the food meets with in the alimentary canal are antiseptic in their action, is what might be antici- pated, not only from the proneness to decomposition of organic matters, such as those used as food, especially under the in- fluence of warmth and moisture, but also from the well-known fact that decomposing flesh (e.g., high game) may be eaten with impunity, while it would certainly cause disease were it allowed to enter the blood by any other route than that formed by the organs of digestion.

The prin- cipal difference between the male and female voice is, therefore, in their pitch ; but they are also distinguished by their tone,âthe male voice is not so soft. The voice presents other varieties besides that of male and female ; there are two kinds of male voice, technically called the bass and tenor, and two kinds of female voice, the contralto and soprano, all differing from each other in tone. The bass voice usually reaches lower than the tenor, and its strength lies in the low notes ; while the tenor voice extends higher than the bass. The contralto voice has generally lower notes than the soprano, and is strongest in the lower notes of the female voice ; while the soprano voice reaches higher in the scale.

They are the means of communicating, in full intensity, the vibrations of the air in the tympanum to the fluid of the labyrinth. This peculiar property of membranes is the result, not of their tenuity alone, but of the elasticity and capability of displacement of their particles; and it is not impaired when, like the mem- brane of the fenestra rotunda, they are not impregnated with moisture. Sonorous vibrations are also communicated without any per- ceptible loss of intensity from the air to the water, when to the membrane forming the medium of communication, there is attached a short, solid body, which occupies the greater part of its surface, and is alone in contact with the water.

The following concentrations of Ca (in mg. per cent) have been reported for the gastric juice of different species: Dog: 0.07 to 0.22 (Rosemann, 1907). 6.08 (average for normal dogsâAustin and Matthews, 1927). 6.65 (average for hypercalcemic dogsâAustin and Matthews, 1927). 1.10 to 3.30 (normal dogsâKirsner and Bryant, 1939). 11.07 to 14.8 (pregnant dogâKirsner and Bryant, 1939). 0.8 to 2.7 (Gray and Bucher, 1941). Cat: 3.4 to 10.6 (Gamble and McIver, 19282). Man: 4.1 to 8.6 (Rudd, 1934). 3.4 to 4.4 (Bonne, Hartz, ef al., 1938). 0.85 to 7.0 (Kirsner and Bryant, 1939). Dr. Grant (1941â) showed that the concentration of Ca in the gastric secretion depends on the type of stimulus that provokes the activity of the gastric glands. The canine gastric juice obtained by faradization of the vagi contains more Ca than the histamine juice, the Ca content thus being independent of the rate of secretion, as may be seen from Figure 113 which represents an experiment    |948        |2489        |\n",

Gas- tric secretion was provoked by pilocarpine in an anesthetized cat; then the effect of the pilocarpine was counterbalanced by atropine, which stopped the flow of acid gastric juice but apparently did not affect the secretion of mucus. This procedure reproduced by arti- ficial means the events that normally occur at the end of the secretory period. The total-chloride concentration fell to the level found in the mucus, while the acidity fell to zero and the solution became alkaline. The results of Bolton and Goodhart are in agreement with Webster's findings and other facts already quoted (Chapter IX) regarding the course of the mucus secretion and its  |1019       |2489        |\n",
      "|es58wtq4|By the term âparalytic secretionâ is meant the phenomenon, first observed by Claude Bernard (1864), where about twenty-four hours after section of the chorda tympani in a dog or cat the submaxillary gland begins to produce a scanty secretion of thin, turbid saliva (its opacity is due to the presence of leukocytes). This secretion reaches a plateau on the seventh or eighth day, begins to diminish in the third week, and stops five to six weeks after the section of the chorda. During this time the gland greatly diminishes in size. No secretion can be elicited from the âparalyticâ gland by any stimula- tion of the mouth cavity. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve pro- duces a flow of saliva. Section of the sympathetic nerve or ex- tirpation of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion does not evoke a âparalytic secretion.â [A detailed description of this phe- nomenon may be found in Langleyâs article on the salivary glands in Schaferâs âText-book of Physiologyâ     |1763       |2489        |\n",

We cannot, however, pretend to define with any close accuracy the probable duration of a case of phthisis which is tending towards a fatal issue. We can tell what is the existing state of the lungs and of the general health, whether the probabilities point to a favourable or an un- favourable course, whether life is a matter of days or years, but the estimate of the duration of any given case is simply a guess, and a guess which is frequently wide of the mark.

The anaemic condition of the brain after death certainly cor- responds very well with the symptoms which occurred during the last few days of life; and the supposition seems very probable that during the previous less severe attacks the condition of the brain was similar, especially as during these attacks the general circulation was evidently much depressed. How this failure of circulation was brought about is not at first sight clear; most pro- bably it is to be ascribed to the close commissural connection existing between the cardiac centres in the cord and the superior encephalic. We know that a sudden shock to the brain will powerfully depress the heart's action; and we may conceive that the central collapse would have the same effect in this case.

In April of the present year, the number of prostitutes found in one night in Leeds (exclusive of some who were classed under the head of known thieves) was 242, rather less than the number for the year ending the 29th Sept., 1869.\" Mr. G.

But he should not be reading a book on the psychology of religion; if, by a mistake, he is, the right course for him to adopt is to close it at this point and to read no further. At the same time, it is probable that the extent to which the psychological study of religion has power to dissolve religious faith is exaggerated. When the psy- chologist describes what he believes to be the mental laws by which such an event as a conversion takes place, he in no way excludes the explanation of it which would be given by the Salvation Armyâthat it takes place by the Grace of God. The physiologistâs explanation that a movement in my finger took place by muscular con- tractions brought about by a neural current started by a change (possibly chemical) in the cerebral cortex, in no way excludes the equally true explanation that I moved my finger because I wanted to. The psychologist and the Salvationist are explaining the same event on different levels. Both may be equally right.

      "|xarhegt8|This tube runs up the back bone, and at last unites with a vein near the left arm; the chyle is thus mixed with the blood, and goes with it to the lungs, when the action of the air while breathing makes it red, and thus it be- comes real blood, which is then required to be sent all over the system. The organs employed in circulating the blood are, the heart, veins, and arteries. The heart is a double organ, each part of which is, mechanically speak- ing, a forcing pump, or an engine so constructed, with valves and chambers, that when in action it will impel the fluid within along the tubes in con- nection, the same as the fire engine propels the water along the hose. The left side of the heart is filled with pure blood, which it propels into a set of tubes connected with it called the arteries. These tubes permeate every part of the body, the hard bones, and colourless fluids, as well as the. flesh ; there is no spot, internal or external, even the most minute but they reach, and thus|99

This leaves no cavity, arrests all possil)le haemorrhage, and in this respect is all that can l)e desired. But there are difficulties and dangers that may arise, even in cases where the method is applicable. There is danger of wounding the ureter or including it in the ligature. A knowledge of the loca- tion of the ureter and its anatomical relations is not always sufficient to guard against this accident, because the ureter may be displaced. By drawing the cyst and ligament out of the abdominal wound, it may be possible to see that tlje ureter is not in the way; bnt this can not always be done, and then one has to depend upon the touch to localize the ureter and avoid it.

The finished perfume should be neither too animal nor too chemical if these points have had careful consideration. There is no definite rule that can be laid down for the choice of fixatives other than the general principle of com- plete harmony between the various constituents employed in any one perfume. Every chemist-perfumer has his own methods and frequently a comprehensive knowledge, acquired by practice, of a certain number of bodies which he is inclined to use as a base when building up all new creations. With a view to extending this list of fixatives, suggestions will be made later regarding the employment of some of the newer and more powerful bodies which it is hoped will be tried with good results.

Work at the Public Abattoir was well maintained during the year, when the total number of animals dealt with was 22,116. This number was slightly below that of the previous year, but it does not call for any special comment. The twelve private slaughterhouses in the City, â 9 registered, and 3 licensed, â were regularly visited on kill- ing days. The premises were well conducted, and no difficulty was experienced in controlling this important branch of the food supply. The question of the extension of the Abattoir is still in abeyance. At times there is considerable congestion, and the slaughtering is being carried out under unsatisfactory circumstances. Every animal slaughtered is systematically examined, so that it is not possible for any diseased conditions to escape the notice of the Inspector. The number of visits made to slaughterhouses was 409.

In den Vereinigten Staaten wendet man die serolo gische Diagnose in Form der Agglutination, und zwar sowohl der ÃbjekttrÃ¤ger-Schnellagglutina- tion als auch der Serum-Langsamagglutination an. Die Agglutination eignet sich aber nur als Reaktionsverfahren fÃ¼r ganze BestÃ¤nde, nicht fÃ¼r Einzeltiere. Therapie. In sehr vielen FÃ¤llen hat sich das Rotlaufserum als Heilmittel bewÃ¤hrt, wenn es frÃ¼hzeitig und in groÃen Dosen, 6â12 Stunden nach dem Auftreten der ersten Krankheitserscheinungen wiederholt subkutan, noch besser intravenÃ¶s oder intramuskulÃ¤r, eingespritzt wird (10-30 ccm). AuÃerdem kann zur Desinfektion des Darmes innerlich Kalomeloder Kreolin gegeben werden. Zur Behandlung des Rotlaufs des Menschen sind angezeigt: Ruhigstellung der erkrankten Glieder, antiseptische UmschlÃ¤ge (Alkohol- oder Sublimat-Alkohol-VerbÃ¤nde),         |1147       |1505

Laurent assumes the animal nature of this organization. They exhibit, according to him, a three-fold mode of propagation :â1st, Germ-like bodies, which he considers as unciliated (non ciMes) buds : 2d, Egg-shaped bodies, which are formed in the spring, and are different from the egg-formed bodies of the later season: 3d, Protean bodies, which liberate themselves from the rhizopodal prolongations of the young Spongilloe. He also speaks of propagation by self-division (scissiparite naturelle) of the old Spongillce. M. Laurent, in the second memoir, goes through the various phases of life of these Spongillce. The\n",

Endosmose and exosmose can only be employed as an analogy for the explanation, and not as an explanation itself, for the simple reason, that they have not yet themselves been explained. Several observations have been published by Laurent on the same subject, i. e., on the Spongillce and their Propagation, in the Comptes Eendus of 1840, vol. ii. p. 478, 694, 1050. M. Laurent assumes the animal nature of this organization. They exhibit, according to him, a three-fold mode of propagation :â\\x80\\x941st, Germ-like bodies, which he considers as unciliated (non ciMes) buds : 2d, Egg-shaped bodies, which are formed in the spring, and are different from the egg-formed bodies of the later season: 3d, Protean bodies, which liberate themselves from the rhizopodal prolongations of the young Spongilloe. He also speaks of propagation by self-division (scissiparite naturelle) of the old Spongillce. M. Laurent, in the second memoir, goes through the various phases of life of these Spongillce.
