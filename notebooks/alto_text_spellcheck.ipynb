      "APPRECIATION AND REGARD During these days of ceaseless conflict, anxiety and\n",
      "unrest among men, when at times it begins to look as if âthe Cau- casianâ\n",
      "really is âplayed out,â perhaps the English-reading world will turn with a\n",
      "sigh of relief to the contemplation of wild animals. At all events, the author\n",
      "has found this diver- sion in his favorite field mentally agreeable and\n",
      "refreshing. In comparison with some of the alleged men who now are cursing this\n",
      "earth by their baneful presence, the so-called âlower animalsâ do not seem\n",
      "so very âlowâ after all! As a friend of the animals, this is a very proper\n",
      "time in which to compare them with men. Furthermore, if thinking men and women\n",
      "desire to know the leading facts concerning the intel- ligence of wild animals,\n",
      "it will be well to consider them now, before the bravest and the best of the\n",
      "wild creatures of the earth go down and out under the merciless and inexorable\n",
      "steam roller that we call Civilization. The intelligence and the ways of wild\n",
      "animals are large subjects. Concerning them I do not offer this volume as an\n",
      "all-in-all production. Out of the great mass of interesting things that might\n",
      "have been included, I have endeavored to select and set forth only enough to\n",
      "make a good series of sample exhibits, without involving the general reader in a\n",
      "hopelessly large collection of details. The most serious ques- tion has been:\n",
      "What shall be left out? Mr. A. R. Spofford, first Librarian of Congress, used to\n",
      "declare that âBooks are made from booksâ; but I call the reader to bear\n",
      "witness that this volume is not a mass of quo- tations. A quoted authority often\n",
      "can be disputed, and for this reason the author has found considerable\n",
      "satisfaction in relying chiefly upon his own testimony. Because I always desire\n",
      "to know the opinions of men who are writing upon their own observations, I have\n",
      "felt free to express my own conclusions regarding the many phases of animal\n",
      "intelligence as their manifestation has impressed me in close-up observations. I\n",
      "have purposely avoided all temptations to discuss the minds and manners of\n",
      "domestic animals, partly because that is by itself a large subject, and partly\n",
      "because their minds have been so greatly influenced by long and close\n",
      "association with man. The domestic mammals and birds deserve inde- pendent\n",
      "treatment. A great many stories of occurrences have been written into this\n",
      "volume, for the purpose of giving the reader all the facts in order that he may\n",
      "form his own opinions of the animal mentality displayed. Most sincerely do I\n",
      "wish that the boys and girls of America, and of the whole world, may be induced\n",
      "to believe that the most interesting thing about a wild animal is its mind and\n",
      "its reasoning, and that a dead animal is only a poor decaying thing. If the feet\n",
      "of the young men would run more to seeing and studying the wild creatures and\n",
      "less to the killing of them, some of the worldâs valuable species might escape\n",
      "being swept away tomorrow, or the day after. The author gratefully acknowledges\n",

      "for wild animals impossible mental and moral standards. The student must not\n",
      "deceive himself by overestimating mental values. If an estimate must be made,\n",
      "make it under the mark of truth rather than above it. While avoiding the folly\n",
      "of idealism, we also must shun the ways of the narrow mind, and the eyes that\n",
      "refuse to see the truth. Wild animals are not superhuman demigods of wis- dom;\n",
      "but neither are they idiots, unable to reason from cause to effect along the\n",

      "study purposes is a spacious, sani- tary and well-stocked zoological park,\n",
      "wherein are assembled great collections of the most interesting land vertebrates\n",
      "that can be procured, from all over the earth. There the student can observe\n",
      "many new traits of wild animal character, as they are brought to the surface by\n",

      "species. Others will reveal marvels in mentality, and teach lessons such as no\n",
      "man can learn from them in the open. To study temperament, there is no place\n",
      "like a zoo. Even there, however, the wisest course,âas it seems to me,âis\n",
      "not to introduce too many appliances as aids to men- tal activity, but rather to\n",
      "see what the animal subject thinks and does by its own initiative. In the\n",
      "testing of memory and the perceptive faculties, training for performances is the\n",
      "best method to pursue. The reader has a right to know that the author of this\n",
      "volume has enjoyed unparalleled opportunities for the obser- vation and study of\n",
      "highly intelligent wild animals, both in their wild haunts and in a great\n",
      "vivarium; and these combined opportunities have covered a long series of years.\n",
      "Before proceeding farther, it is desirable to define certain terms that\n",
      "frequently will be used in these pages. The Animal Brain is the generator of the\n",
      "mind, and the clearing-house of the senses. As a mechanism, the brain of man is\n",
      "the most perfect, and in the descent through the mam- mals, birds, reptiles,\n",
      "amphibians and fishes, the brain pro- gressively is simplified in form and\n",
      "function. Thought is the result of the various processes of the brain and\n",
      "nervous system, stimulated by the contributions of the senses. Sanity is the\n",
      "state of normal, orderly and balanced thought, as formulated by a healthy brain.\n",
      "Insanity is a state of mental disease, resulting in disor- dered, unbalanced and\n",
      "chaotic thought, destitute of reason. Reason is the manifestation of correct\n",
      "observation and healthful thought which recognizes both cause and effect, and\n",
      "leads from premise to conclusion. Intelligence is created by the possession of\n",
      "knowledge either inherited or acquired. It may be either latent or active; and\n",
      "it is the forerunner of reason. Instinct is the knowledge or impulse which\n",
      "animals or men derive from their ancestors by inheritance, and which they obey,\n",
      "either consciously or subconsciously in working out their own preservation,\n",
      "increase and betterment. Instinct of- ten functions as a sixth sense. Education\n",
      "is the acquirement of knowledge by precept or by observation; but animals as\n",
      "well as men may be self-taught, and become self-educated, by the diligent\n",
      "exercise of the ob- serving and reasoning faculties. The adjustment of a wild\n",
      "animal mind to conditions unknown to its ancestors is through the process of\n",
      "self-education, and by logical reasoning from premise to conclusion. The wild\n",
      "animal must think, or die. Animal intelligence varies in quantity and quality as\n",
      "much as animals vary in size. Idiots, maniacs and sleeping persons are the only\n",
      "classes of human beings who are devoid of intelli- gence and reasoning power.\n",
      "Idiots and maniacs also are often devoid of the common animal instinct that\n",
      "ordinarily promotes self-preservation from fire, water and high places. A\n",
      "heavily- sleeping person is often so sodden in slumber that his senses of smell\n",
      "and hearing are temporarily dead; and many a sleep- ing man has been asphyxiated\n",
      "by gas or smoke, or burned to death, because his deadeiied senses failed to\n",
      "arouse him at the critical moment. (This dangerous condition of mind can be\n",
      "cured by efforts of the will, exercised prior to sleep, through a determination\n",
      "resolutely to arouse and investigate every un- usual sensation that registers\n",
      "âdangerâ on any one of the senses.) The normal individual sleeps with a\n",
      "subconscious and sensitive mind, from which thought and reason have not been\n",
      "entirely eliminated. Every act of a man or animal, vertebrate or invertebrate,\n",
      "is based upon either reason or hereditary instinct. It is a mis- take to assume\n",
      "that because an organism is small it neces- sarily has no âmind,â and none\n",
      "of the propelling impulse that we call thought. The largest whale may have less\n",
      "intelligence and constructive reasoning than a trap-door spider, a bee or an\n",
      "ant. To deny this is to deny the evidence of oneâs senses. A Measure for\n",
      "Animal Intelligence. The intelligence of an animal may be estimated by taking\n",
      "into account, sep- arately, its mental qualities, about as follows: 1. General\n",
      "knowledge of surrounding conditions. 2. Powers of independent observation and\n",
      "reasoning. 3. Memory. 4. Comprehension under tuition. 5. Accuracy in the\n",
      "execution of manâs orders. Closely allied to these are the moral qualities\n",
      "which go to make up an animalâs temperament and disposition, about as follows:\n",
      "1. Amiability, which guarantees security to its associates. 2. Patience, or\n",
      "submission to discipline and training. 3. Courage, which gives self-confidence\n",
      "and steadiness. 4. A disposition to obedience, with cheerfulness. All normal\n",
      "vertebrate animals exercise their intelligence in accordance with their own\n",
      "rules of logic. Had they not been able to do so, it is reasonable to suppose\n",
      "that they could never have developed into vertebrates, reaching even up to man\n",
      "himself. According to the laws of logic, this proposition is no more open to\n",
      "doubt or dispute than is the existence of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. But\n",
      "few persons have seen the Canyon, and far fewer ever have proven its existence\n",
      "by de- scending to its bottom; but none the less Reason admonishes all of us\n",
      "that the great chasm exists, and is not a debatable question. To men and women\n",
      "who really know the vertebrate animals by contact with some of them upon their\n",
      "own levels, the reason- ing power of the latter is not a debatable question. The\n",
      "only real question is: how far does their intelligence carry them? It is with\n",
      "puzzled surprise that we have noted the curious dili- gence of the professors of\n",
      "animal psychology in always writing of âanimal behaviorâ and never of\n",
      "old-fashioned, common- sense animal intelligence. Can it be possible that any\n",
      "one of them really refuses to concede to the wild animal the pos- session of a\n",
      "mind, and a working intelligence? Yes. Animals do reason. If any one truth has\n",
      "come out of all the critical or uncritical study of the animal mind that has\n",
      "been going on for two centuries, it is this. Animals do reason; they always have\n",
      "reasoned, and as long as animals live they never will cease to reason. The\n",
      "higher wild animals possess and display the same fun- damental passions and\n",
      "emotions that animate the human race. This fact is subject to intelligent\n",
      "analysis, discussion and de- velopment, but it is not by any means a\n",
      "âquestionâ subject to debate. In the most intellectual of the quadrupeds,\n",
      "birds and reptiles, the display of fear, courage, love, hate, pleasure,\n",
      "displeasure, confidence, suspicion, jealousy, pity, greed and generosity are so\n",
      "plainly evident that even children can and do recognize them. To the serious and\n",
      "open-minded student who devotes prolonged thought to these things, they bring\n",
      "the wild animal very near to the âlord of creation.â To the question,\n",
      "âHave wild animals souls?â we reply, âThat is a debatable question. Read;\n",
      "then think it over.â Methods with the Animal Mind. In the study of ani- mal\n",
      "minds, much depends upon the method employed. It seems to me that the\n",
      "problem-box method of the investigators of âanimal behaviorâ leaves much to\n",
      "be desired. Certainly it is not calculated to develop the mental status of\n",
      "animals along lines of natural mental progression. To place a wild creature in a\n",
      "great artificial contrivance, fitted with doors, cords, levers, passages and\n",
      "what not, is enough to daze or frighten any timid animal out of its normal state\n",
      "of mind and nerves. To put a wild sapajou monkey,âweak, timid and afraid,â\n",
      "in a strange and formidable prison box filled with strange machinery, and call\n",
      "upon it to learn or to invent strange me- chanical processes, is like bringing a\n",
      "boy of ten years up to a four-cylinder duplex Hoe printing-and-folding press,\n",
      "and saying to him: âNow, go ahead and find out how to run this machine, and\n",
      "print both sides of a signature upon it.â The average boy would shrink from\n",
      "the mechanical mon- ster, and have no stomach whatever for âtrial by error.â\n",
      "I think that the principle of determining the mind of a wild animal along the\n",
      "lines of the professor is not the best way. It should be developed along the\n",
      "natural lines of the wild-animal mind. It should be stimulated to do what it\n",
      "feels most inclined to do, and educated to achieve real mental progress. I think\n",
      "that the ideal way to study the minds of apes, baboons and monkeys would be to\n",
      "choose a good location in a tropical or sub-tropical climate that is neither too\n",
      "wet nor too dry, enclose an area of five acres with an unclimbable fence, and\n",
      "divide it into as many corrals as there are species to be experimented upon.\n",
      "Each corral would need a shelter house and indoor playroom. The stage properties\n",
      "should be varied and abundant, and designed to stimulate curiosity as well as\n",
      "activity. Somewhere in the program I would try to teach orang-utans and\n",
      "chimpanzees the properties of fire, and how to make and tend fires. I would try\n",
      "to teach them the seed-planting idea, and the meaning of seedtime and harvest. I\n",
      "would teach sanitation and cleanliness of habit,âa thing much more easily done\n",
      "than most persons suppose. I would teach my apes to wash dishes and to cook, and\n",
      "I am sure that some of them would do no worse than some human members of the\n",
      "profes- sion who now receive $50 per month, or more, for spoiling food. In one\n",
      "corral I would mix up a chimpanzee, an orang-utan, a golden baboon and a\n",

      "generally, temperament is the foundation of intelligence and progress. Fifty\n",
      "years ago Fowler and Wells, the founders of the science of phrenology and\n",
      "physiognomy, very wisely differentiated and defined four âtemperamentsâ of\n",
      "mankind. The six types now recognized by me are the morose, lymphatic, sanguine,\n",
      "nervous, hysterical and combative; and their names adequately describe them.\n",
      "This classification applies to the higher wild animals, quite as truly as to\n",
      "men. By the manager of wild animals in cap- tivity, wild-animal temperament\n",
      "universally is recognized and treated as a factor of great practical importance.\n",
      "Mistakes in judging the temper of dangerous animals easily lead to trage- dies\n",
      "and sudden death. Fundamentally the temperament of a man or an animal is an\n",
      "inheritance from ancestors near or remote. In the human species a morose or\n",
      "hysterical temperament may possibly be corrected or improved, by education and\n",
      "effort. With animals this is rarely possible. The morose gorilla gives way to\n",
      "cheerfulness only when it is placed in ideally pleasant and stimulating social\n",
      "conditions. This, however, very seldom is possible. The nervous deer, bear or\n",
      "monkey is usually ner- vous to the end of its days. The morose and hysterical\n",
      "temperaments operate against mental development, progress and happiness. In the\n",
      "human species among individuals of equal mental calibre, the sanguine individual\n",
      "is due to rise higher and go farther than his nervous or lymphatic rivals. A\n",
      "characteristic temperament may embrace the majority of a whole species, or be\n",
      "limited to a few individuals. Many species are permanently characterized by the\n",
      "temperament common to the majority of their individual members. Thus, among the\n",
      "great apes the gorilla species is either morose or lymphatic; and it is\n",
      "manifested by persistent inactivity and sullenness. This leads to loss of\n",
      "appetite, indigestion, inac- tivity and early death. Major Pennyâs âJohn\n",

      "and is well liked by everybody. Except when quite young, the chimpanzee is\n",

      "difficult to manage. After seven years of age (puberty) it is rough, domi-\n",

      "where it is surely fitted to exist in a state of nature even more successfully\n",
      "than the raccoon or opossum. The temper of the coati mundi is essentially\n",
      "quarrelsome and aggressive. While young, they are reasonably peaceful, but when\n",
      "they reach adult age, they become aggressive, and quarrels are frequent.\n",
      "Separations then are very necessary, and it is rare indeed that more than two\n",

      "disagreeable temper and most belligerently inclined. We hunted them in open\n",
      "whale-boats under the shadows of Green- landâs mountain-bound coast, in the\n",
      "Whale Sound region, Lat. 77 degrees North. âWe hunted among animals never\n",
      "before molested, except by the Eskimo who (so far as I was able to ascertain)\n",
      "hunt them only during the winter season on the sea ice. We found animals whose\n",

      "contact with the white man and his ingenious devices of slaughter. âThe walrus\n",
      "has a steady nerve and a thoroughly convincing roar. They have fought their kind\n",
      "and the elements for centuries and centuries, and know no fear. This, then, was\n",
      "the animal we sought in order to secure food for our dog teams. I can conceive\n",
      "of no form of big game hunting so conducive to great mental excite- ment and\n",
      "physical activity as walrus hunting from an open whale- boat. At the completion\n",
      "of such a hunt I have seen Eskimo so excited and worked up that they were taken\n",

      "walrus were found, as a knowledge of the depth of water would have furnished\n",
      "some information as to the distances to which the animal will dive in search of\n",
      "food. âThe stomachs of all half- and full-grown walrus taken in Whale Sound\n",
      "were without exception well filled with freshly opened clams, with very few\n",
      "fragments of shells in evidence; the removal of the clam from the shell being as\n",
      "neatly accomplished as though done by an expert oysterman. âIn most cases\n",
      "these segregated herds of walrus were in charge of a large bull who generally\n",
      "occupied a central position in the mass of animals. Upon approaching such a herd\n",
      "for the first time, and when within about 200 feet, a large bull would lift his\n",
      "head, sniff audibly in our direction and give a loud grunt which apparently\n",
      "struck a responsive chord in the other sleeping animals. They would grunt in\n",

      "then during the fusillade which followed there occurred what might be called an\n",

      "to the edge of the ice-pan, and there, apparently under the protection of the\n",

      "The young bulls followed, and I recall no exceptions where the last animal into\n",

      "first became aware of a remarkable phenomenon. We found that when excited they\n",
      "would continue their roaring under water, and these strange sounds coming to us\n",
      "from below added considerably to the excite- ment of the chase. Although the\n",

      "Icquah, one of our native hunters, showed me in the deck of his kyak two mended\n",

      "sides, giving the appearance of three animals swim- ming abreast. The first time\n",
      "I witnessed this I did not comprehend its real meaning, but on another occasion\n",
      "in McCormick Bay I saw a wounded animal leaving a trail of blood and oil,\n",
      "supported on either side by two uninjured ones. They were making a hasty retreat\n",
      "and would occasionally dive together, but would quickly return to the surface.\n",
      "âWe found the most effective exposed spot to place a bullet was at the base of\n",

      "and normal elephant is distinctly sanguine, but a nervous or hysterical\n",
      "individual is easily developed by bad conditions or abuse. Adult male ele-\n",
      "phants are subject to various degrees of what we may as well call sexual\n",

      "and he gradually grew worse, and increasingly dangerous to his keepers, until\n",
      "finally it was necessary to end his troubles painlessly with a bullet through\n",
      "his brain. The Rhinoceros is a sanguine animal, of rather dull vision and slow\n",

      "LANGUAGE OF WILD ANIMALS IANGUAGE is the means by which men and animals express\n",
      "their thoughts. Of language there are four kinds: vocal, pictured, written and\n",
      "sign language. Any vocal sound uttered for the purpose of conveying thought, or\n",

      "average visitor works overtime in watching them. I have learned the language of\n",
      "our bears sufficiently that whenever I hear one of them give tongue I know what\n",
      "he says. For example: In warning or threatening an enemy, the sloth bear says:\n",

      "says: âAw-aw-aw!â A babyâs call for its mother is âRow! Row!â A\n",

      "cries of bears, although the ability to do so is sometimes of value to the party\n",
      "of the second part. For example: One day in February I was sitting in my old\n",
      "office in the Service Building, engrossed in I know not what important and\n",
      "solemn matter. The park was quiet; for the snow lay nine inches deep over all.\n",
      "There were no visitors, and the main- tenance men were silently shoveling. Over\n",
      "the hill from the bear dens came the voice of a bear. It said, as plainly as\n",
      "print: âErr-wow!â I said to myself: âThat sounds like a distress call,â\n",
      "and listened to hear it repeated. Again it came: âErr-wow!â I caught up my\n",
      "hat and hastened over the hill toward the bear dens. On the broad concrete walk,\n",
      "about a hundred feet from the dens, four men were industriously shoveling snow,\n",
      "unaware that anything was wrong anywhere except on the pay-roll, opposite their\n",
      "names. Guided by the cries that came from âThe Nurseryâ den, where six\n",
      "yearling cubs were kept, I quickly caught sight of the trouble. One of our\n",
      "park-born brown bear cubs was hang- ing fast by one forefoot from the top of the\n",
      "barred partition. He had climbed to the top of the ironwork, thrust one front\n",
      "paw through between two of the bars (for bears are the greatest busybodies on\n",
      "earth), and when he sought to withdraw it, the sharp point of a bar in the\n",
      "overhang of the tree-guard had buried itself in the back of his paw, and held\n",
      "him fast. It Seemed as if his leg was broken, and also dislocated at the\n",
      "shoulder. No wonder the poor little chap squalled for help. His mother, on the\n",
      "other side of the partition, was almost frantic with baffled sympathy, for she\n",
      "could do nothing to help him. It did not take more than a quarter of a minute to\n",
      "have several men running for crowbars and other things, and within five minutes\n",
      "from the discovery we were in the den ready for action. The little chap gave two\n",
      "or three cries to let us know how badly it hurt his leg to hang there, then bent\n",
      "his small mind upon rendering us assistance. First we lifted him up bodily, and\n",
      "held him, to remove the strain. Then, by good luck, we had at hand a stout iron\n",
      "bar with a U-shaped end; and with that under the injured wrist, and a crowbar to\n",
      "spring the treacherous overhang, we lifted the foot clear, and lowered little\n",
      "Brownie to the floor. From first to last he helped us all he could, and seemed\n",
      "to realize that it was clearly âno fairâ to bite or scratch. Fortunately the\n",
      "leg was neither broken nor dislocated, and although Brownie limped for ten days,\n",
      "he soon was all right again. After the incident had been closed, I gave the men\n",
      "a brief lecture on the language of bears, and the necessity of being able to\n",
      "recognize the distress call. You can chase bison, elephants and deer all day\n",
      "without hearing a single vocal utterance. They know through long experience the\n",
      "value of silence. The night after I shot my second elephant we noted an\n",
      "exception. The herd had been divided by our onslaught. Part of it had gone\n",
      "north, part of it south, and our camp for the night (beside the dead tusker) lay\n",
      "midway between the two. About bedtime the elephants began signalling to each\n",
      "other by trumpeting, and what they sounded was âThe assem- bly.â They called\n",
      "and answered repeatedly; and finally it became clear to my native followers that\n",
      "the two herds were advancing to unite, and were likely to meet in our vicinity.\n",
      "That particular trumpet call was different from any other I have ever heard. It\n",
      "was a regular âHelloâ signal-call, entirely different from the\n",
      "âTah/00-eâ blast which once came from a feeding herd and guided us to it.\n",
      "But it is only on rare occasions that elephants communi- cate with each other by\n",
      "sound. I once knew a general alarm to be communicated throughout a large herd by\n",
      "the sign language, and a retreat organized and carried out in absolute silence.\n",
      "Their danger signals to each other must have been made with their trunks and\n",
      "their ears; but we saw none of them, because all the animals were concealed from\n",
      "our view except when the two scouts of the herd were hunting for us. In\n",
      "captivity an elephant trumpets in protest, or through fear, or through rage; but\n",
      "I am obliged to confess that as yet I cannot positively distinguish one from the\n",
      "other. Once in the Zoological Park I heard our troublesome Indian elephant,\n",
      "Alice, roaring continuously as if in pain. It con- tinued at such a rate that I\n",
      "hurried over to the Elephant House to investigate. And there I saw a droll\n",
      "spectacle. Keeper Richards had taken Alice out into her yard for exer- cise and\n",
      "had ordered her to follow him. And there he was disgustedly marching around the\n",

      "we could manage it by showing the animals where we wished them to go to work. We\n",
      "set a 12-inch plank on its edge, all the way across the dam site, and pegged it\n",
      "down. Above it the water soon formed a little pool and began to flow over the\n",

      "are particularly active, indicates that the construction of the tube involves\n",
      "other material than the silken lining employed by many burrowing spiders. In the\n",
      "excavation of the tube and retention of the walls, the spider appears to employ\n",
      "a glairy substance, which thoroughly saturates the soil and renders the interior\n",
      "of the tube of almost cement-like hardness. It is then plastered with a thick\n",
      "jet of silk from the spinning glands. This in- terior finishing process appears\n",
      "to be quite rapid, a burrow being readily lined within a couple of hours. âThe\n",
      "construction of the trap-door is a far more complicated process, this convex,\n",
      "beautifully bevelled entrance with its hinge requiring real scientific skill.\n",
      "Judging from observations on a number of specimens, the work is done from the\n",
      "outside, the spider first spinning a net-like covering over the mouth of the\n",
      "tube. This is thickened by weaving the body over the net, each motion leaving a\n",
      "smoky trail of silk. Earth is then shoveled into the covering, the spider\n",
      "carefully pushing the particles toward the centre, which soon sags, and assumes\n",
      "the proper curvature, and automatically moulds against the bevelled walls of the\n",
      "tube. âThe shoveling process must be nicely regulated to produce the proper\n",
      "bevel and thickness of the door. Then the cement- ing process is applied to the\n",

      "often calmly rest an hour without a move,âit appears that the edges of the\n",
      "door are now subjected, by the stout and sharp fangs, to a cutting process like\n",
      "that of a can opener, leaving a portion of the marginal silk to act as a hinge.\n",
      "This hinge afterward receives some finishing touches, and the top of the door is\n",

      "ANIMALS WE repeat that the most interesting features of a wild animal are its\n",
      "mind, its thoughts, and the results of its reasoning. Besides these, its\n",
      "classification, distribution and anatomy are of secondary importance; but at the\n",
      "same time they help to form the foundation on which to build the psychology of\n",
      "species and individuals. Let no student make the mistake of concluding that when\n",
      "he has learned an animalâs place in nature there is nothing more to pursue.\n",
      "After fifty years of practical experience with wild animals of many species, I\n",
      "am reluctantly compelled to give the prize for greatest cunning and foresight in\n",
      "self-preservation to the common brown rat,âthe accursed âdomesticâ rat\n",
      "that has adopted man as his perpetual servant, and regards manâs goods as his\n",
      "lawful prey. When all other land animals have been exterminated from the earth,\n",
      "the brown rat will remain, to harry and to rob the Last Man. The brown rat has\n",
      "persistently accompanied man all over the world. Millions have been spent in\n",
      "fighting him and the bubonic-plague flea that he cheerfully carries in his\n",
      "offensive fur. For him no place that contains food is too hot or too cold, too\n",
      "wet or too dry. Many old sailors claim to believe that rats will desert at the\n",
      "dock an outward-bound ship that is fated to be lost at sea; but that certificate\n",
      "of superhuman foreknowdedge needs a backing of evidence before it can be\n",
      "accepted. Of all wild animals, rats do the greatest number of âimpos- sibleâ\n",
      "things. We have matched our wits against rat cunning until a madhouse yawned\n",
      "before us. Twice in my life all my traps and poisons have utterly failed, and\n",

      "H. Wright, of Spokane, in his interesting book on âThe Grizzly Bear,â and\n",
      "for other reasons, I am convinced that the Rocky Mountain silver-tip grizzly is\n",
      "our brightest North American animal, and very keen of nose, eye, ear and brain.\n",
      "Mr. Wright says that âthe grizzly bear far excels in cunning any other animal\n",
      "found throughout the Rocky Mountains, and, for that matter, he far excels them\n",
      "all combined.â While the last clause is a large order, I will not dispute the\n",
      "opinion of a man of keen intelligence who has lived much among the most\n",
      "important and interesting wild animals of the Rockies. In the Bitter Root\n",
      "Mountains Mr. Wright and his hunting party once set a bear trap for a grizzly,\n",
      "in a pen of logs, well baited with fresh meat. On the second day they found the\n",
      "pen demolished, the bait taken out, and everything that was movable piled on the\n",
      "top of the trap. The trap was again set, this time loosely, under a bed of moss.\n",
      "The grizzly came and joyously ate all the meat that was scattered around the\n",
      "trap, but the moss and the trap were left untouched. And then followed a major\n",
      "operation in bear trapping. A mile away there was a steep slope of smooth rock,\n",
      "bounded at its foot by a creek. On one side was a huge tangle of down timber, on\n",
      "the other side loomed some im- passable rocks; and a tiny meadow sloped away at\n",
      "the top. The half-fleshed carcasses of two dead elk were thrown half way down\n",
      "the rock slide, to serve as a bait. On the two sides two bear guns were set, and\n",
      "to their triggers were attached two long silk fish-lines, stretched taut and\n",
      "held parallel to each other, extending across the rocky slope. The idea was that\n",
      "the bear could not by any possibility reach the bait from above or below,\n",
      "without setting off at least one gun, and getting a bullet through his\n",
      "shoulders. On the first night, no guns went off. The next morning it was found\n",
      "that the bear had crossed the stream and climbed straight up toward the bait\n",
      "until he reached the first fish-line; where he stopped. Without pressing the\n",
      "string sufficiently to set off its gun, he followed it to the barrier of trees.\n",
      "Being balked there, he turned about, retraced his steps carefully and followed\n",
      "the string to the barrier of rocks. Being blocked there, he back-tracked down\n",
      "the slide and across the stream, over the way he came. Then he widely circled\n",
      "the whole theatre, and came down toward the bait from the little meadow at its\n",
      "top of the slide. Presently he reached the upper fish-line, twelve feet away\n",
      "from the first one. First he followed this out to the log barrier, then back to\n",
      "the rock ledge that was supposed to be unclimb- able. There he scrambled up the\n",
      "âimpossibleâ rocks, ne- gotiated the ledge foot by foot, and successfully\n",
      "got around the end of line No. 2. Getting between the two lines he sailed out\n",
      "across the slope to the elk carcasses, feasted sump- tuously, and then meandered\n",
      "out the way he came, without having disturbed a soul. All this was done at\n",
      "night, and in darkness; and presumably that bear is there to this day, alive and\n",
      "well. No wonder Mr. Wright has a high opinion of the grizzly bear as a thinking\n",
      "animal. In hiding their homes and young, either in burrows or in nests on the\n",
      "ground, wild rabbits and hares are wonderfully skilful, even under new\n",
      "conditions. Being quite unable to fight, or even to dig deeply, they are wholly\n",
      "dependent upon their wits in keeping their young alive by hiding them. Thanks to\n",
      "their keenness in concealment, the gray rabbit is plentiful throughout the\n",
      "eastern United States in spite of its millions of enemies. Is it not wonderful?\n",
      "The number killed by hunters last year in Pennsylvania was about 3,500,000' The\n",
      "most amazing risk that I ever saw taken by a rabbit was made by a gray rabbit\n",

      "that the buck is more keen-witted than the doe; but this is a debatable\n",
      "question. Throughout the year the buck thinks only of himself. During fully\n",

      "paramount duty of saving her fawns from their numerous enemies. This, I am quite\n",
      "sure, is the handicap which makes it so much easier to kill a doe in the autumn\n",
      "hunting season than to bag a fully antlered and sophisticated buck who has only\n",
      "himself to consider. The white-tailed deer saves its life by skulking low in\n",
      "timber and thick brush. This is why it so successfully resists the extermination\n",
      "that has almost swept the mule deer, ante- lope, white goat, moose and elk from\n",
      "all the hunting-grounds of the United States. Thanks to its alertness in seeing\n",

      "appear. That state has twenty-six such deer sanc- tuaries,âwell filled with\n",
      "deer. The moose and caribou dwell upon open or half-open ground, and are at the\n",
      "mercy of the merciless long-range rifles. Their keenness does not count much\n",
      "against rifles that can shoot and kill at a quarter of a mile. In the rutting\n",
      "season the bull moose of Maine or New Brunswick is easily deceived by the\n",
      "âcallâ of a birch-bark megaphone in the hands of a moose hunter who imitates\n",
      "the love call of the cow moose so skilfully that neither moose nor man can\n",

      "him at long range. In the days of black powder and short ranges the sheep had a\n",
      "chance to escape; but now he has none whatever. He has keener vision and more\n",
      "alertness than the goat, but as a real life-saving factor that amounts to\n",
      "nothing! Wild sheep are easily and quickly exterminated. The mountain goat has\n",
      "no protection except elevation and precipitous rocks, and to the hunter who has\n",
      "the energy to climb up to him he, too, is easy prey. Usually his biped enemy\n",

      "of the multitude of exhibits available I will limit myself to three, widely\n",
      "separated. In the first place, the habitations of the savage and barbaric tribes\n",
      "are usually the direct result of their own mental and moral deficiencies. The\n",
      "Eskimo is an ex- ception, because his home and its location are dictated by the\n",
      "hard and fierce circumstances which dictate to him what he must do. Often he is\n",

      "might have been rich and prosperous agriculturists or herdsmen had they\n",
      "developed sufficient intelligence to see the wisdom of regular industry.\n",
      "Consider first the lowest of three primitive tribes that inhabit the extreme\n",

      "flapping over the naked and repulsive body. They make no houses, and on shore\n",
      "their only shelters from the wind and snow and chilling rains are rabbit-like\n",
      "forms of brush, broken off by hand. These people are lower in the scale of\n",
      "intelligence than any wild animal species known to me; for they are mentally too\n",
      "dull and low to maintain themselves on a continuing basis. Their hundred years\n",
      "of contact with man has taught them little; and numerically they are decreasing\n",
      "so rapidly that the world will soon see the absolute finish of the tribe. In the\n",
      "best of the three tribes, the Tchuelclus, the birth rate is so low that within\n",

      "âthink,â or âreason,â any more than the animals I have named? It is a\n",
      "far cry from the highest to the lowest of the human race; and we hold that the\n",
      "highest animals intellectually^are higher than the lowest men. Now go with me\n",
      "for a moment to the lofty and dense tropical forest in the heart of the\n",

      "wild elephant, rhinoceros and sladang. And there dwells a jungle tribe called\n",
      "the Jackoons, some members of which I met at their family home, and observed\n",
      "literally in their own ancestral tree. Their house was not wholly bad, but it\n",
      "might have been ioo per cent better. It was merely a platform of small poles,\n",
      "placed like a glorified birdâs nest in the spreading forks of a many-branched\n",
      "tree, about twenty feet from the ground. The main supports were bark-lashed to\n",
      "the large branches of the family tree. Over this there was a rude roof of long\n",
      "grass, which had a fairly intelligent slope. As a shelter from rain, the Jackoon\n",
      "house left much to be desired. The scanty loin cloths of the habitants knew no\n",
      "such thing as wash-day or line. With all its drawbacks, however, this habitation\n",
      "was far more adequate to the needs of its builders than the cold brush\n",
      "rabbit-forms of the Patagonian canoe Indians. We now come to a tribe which has\n",
      "reduced the problem of housing and home life to its lowest common denominator.\n",
      "The Poonans of Central Borneo, discovered and described by Carl Bock, build no\n",
      "houses of any kind, not even huts of green branches; and their only overture\n",
      "toward the promotion of personal comfort in the home is a five-foot grass mat\n",
      "spread upon the sodden earth, to lie upon when at rest. And this, in a country\n",
      "where in the so-called âdry seasonâ it rains half the time, and in the\n",

      "Ceylon, known as the Veddahs, could count no more than five, that they could not\n",
      "comprehend âday after to- morrow,â and that their vocabulary was limited to\n",
      "about 200 words. It is very probable that the language of the Poonans and the\n",
      "Jackoons is equally limited. And what are we to conclude from all the foregoing?\n",
      "Briefly, I should say that the architectural skill of the orioles, the caciques\n",
      "and the weaver birds is greater than that of the South Patagonia native, the\n",
      "Jackoon and the Poonan. I should say that those bird homes yield to their makers\n",

      "the most interesting subjects for psychologic study of all the wild-animal\n",
      "species with which the writer is acquainted. Primarily this is due to the fact\n",
      "that intellectually and temperamentally, as well as an- atomically, these\n",
      "animals stand very near to man himself, and closely resemble him. The great apes\n",
      "mentioned can give visible expression to a wide range of thoughts and emotions.\n",
      "The voice of the adult orang-utan is almost absent, and only sufficient to\n",
      "display on rare occasions. What little there is of it, in animals over six years\n",
      "of age, is very deep and guttural, and may best be described as a deep-bass\n",
      "roar. Under excitement the orang can produce a roar by inhalation. Young orangs\n",
      "under two years of age often whine, or shriek or scream with anger, like excited\n",
      "human children, but with their larger growth that vocal power seems to leave\n",

      "harum-scarum nervous vivacity of the chimpanzee, the value of the former is\n",

      "but the moment it sus- pects malicious unfairness, or what it regards as a\n",
      "âmean trick,â it instantly becomes angry and resentful. Once when I\n",

      "into a towering passion, and seek to wreak vengeance upon me. Her lips idrew far\n",
      "back in a savage snarl, and she denounced my perfidy by piercing cries of rage\n",

      "reach of her teeth, for the punishment which she felt that I deserved. A large\n",
      "male orang-utan named Dohong, under a similar test, revealed a very different\n",
      "mental attitude. He dexter- ously snatched a valuable watch-charm from a visitor\n",
      "who stood inside the railing of his cage, and fled with it to the top of his\n",
      "balcony. As quickly as possible I thrust my handker- chief between the bars, and\n",
      "waved it vigorously, to attract him. At once the animal came down to me, to\n",
      "secure another trophy, and before he realized his position I successfully\n",
      "snatched the charm from him, and restored it unharmed to its owner. Do- hong\n",
      "seemed to regard the episode as a good joke. Without manifesting any resentment\n",
      "he turned a somersault on his straw, then climbed upon his trapeze and began to\n",
      "perform, as if nothing in particular had occurred. The orang is distinctly an\n",
      "animal of more serene temper and more philosophic mind than the chimpanzee. This\n",
      "has led some authors erroneously to pronounce the orang an animal of morose and\n",
      "sluggish disposition, and mentally inferior to the chimpanzee. After a close\n",
      "personal acquaintance with about forty captive orangs of various sizes, I am\n",
      "convinced that the facts do not warrant that conclusion. The orang-utans of the\n",
      "New York Zoological Park certainly have been as cheerful in disposition, as fond\n",
      "of exercise and as fertile in droll per- formances as our chimpanzees. Even\n",
      "though the mind of the chimpanzee does act more quickly than that of its rival,\n",
      "and even though its movements are usually more rapid and more precise, the mind\n",
      "of the orang carries that animal precisely as far. Moreover, in its native\n",
      "jungles the orang habitually builds for itself a very comfortable nest on which\n",
      "to rest and sleep, which the chimpanzee ordinarily does not do. I think that the\n",
      "exact mental status of an anthropoid ape is best revealed by an attempt to train\n",
      "it to do some particular thing, in a manner that the trainer elects. Usually\n",
      "about five lessons, carefully observed, will afford a good index of the\n",
      "pupilâs mental capabilities. Some chimpanzees are too nervous to be taught,\n",
      "some are too obstinate, and others are too im- patient of restraint. Some\n",
      "orang-utans are hopelessly indif- ferent to the business in hand, and refuse to\n",
      "become inter- ested in it. I think that no orang is too dull to learn to sit at\n",
      "a table, and eat with the utensils that are usually considered sacred to manâs\n",
      "use, but the majority of them care only for the food, and take no interest in\n",
      "the function. On the other hand, the average chimpanzee is as restless as a\n",
      "newly-caught eel, and its mind is dominated by a desire to climb far beyond the\n",
      "reach of restraining hands, and to do almost anything save that which is\n",
      "particularly desired. Among the twenty or more orangs which up to 1922 have been\n",
      "exhibited in the Zoological Park, two stand out with special prominence, by\n",
      "reason of their unusual mental qualities. They differed widely from each other.\n",
      "One was a born actor and imitator, who loved human partnership in his daily\n",
      "affairs. The other was an original thinker and reasoner, with a genius for\n",
      "invention, and at all times impatient of training and re- straint. The first was\n",
      "named Rajah, the latter was called Dohong. Rajah was a male orang, and about\n",
      "four years of age when received by us. His high and broad forehead, large eyes\n",
      "and general breadth of cranium and jaw marked him at once as belonging to the\n",
      "higher caste of orangs. Dealers and experts have no difficulty in recognizing at\n",
      "one glance an orang that has a good brain and good general physique from those\n",
      "which are thin-headed, narrow-jawed, weak in body and unlikely to live long. At\n",
      "the Zoological Park we have tested out the orang-utanâs susceptibility to\n",
      "training, and proven that the task is so simple and easy that even amateurs can\n",
      "accomplish much in a short time. Desiring that several of our orangs should\n",
      "perform in public, we instructed the primate keepers to proceed along certain\n",
      "lines and educate them to that idea. Naturally, the performance was laid out to\n",
      "match our own possibilities. In a public park, where only a very little time can\n",
      "be devoted to training, we do not linger long over an animal that is either\n",
      "stupid or obstinate. Those which cannot be trained easily and quickly are\n",
      "promptly set aside as ineligible. Without any great amount of labor, and with no\n",
      "real diffi- culty, our orangs were trained to perform the following simple acts:\n",
      "1. To sit at table, and eat and drink like humans. This involved eating sliced\n",
      "bananas with a fork, pouring out milk from a teapot into a teacup, drinking out\n",
      "of a teacup, drinking out of a beer-bottle, using a toothpick, striking a match,\n",
      "lighting a cigarette, smoking and spitting like a man. 2. To ride a tricycle, or\n",
      "bicycle. 3. To put on a pair of trousers, adjust the suspenders, put on a\n",
      "sweater or coat, and a cap, reversing the whole operation after the performance.\n",
      "4. To drive nails with a hammer. 5. Use a key to lock and unlock a padlock. The\n",
      "animal most proficient in this became able to select the right Yale key out of a\n",
      "bunch of half a dozen or more, with as much quick- ness and precision as the\n",
      "average man displays. The orang Dohong learned to pedal and to guide a tricycle\n",
      "in about three lessons. He caught the two ideas almost instantly, and soon\n",
      "brought his muscles under control sufficiently to ride successfully, even under\n",
      "difficult conditions. It was quickly recognized that our Rajah was a\n",
      "particularly good subject, and with him the keepers went farther than with the\n",
      "four others. From the first moment, the training operations were to him both\n",
      "interesting and agreeable. The animal en- joyed the work, and he entered into it\n",
      "so heartily that in two weeks he was ready to dine in public, somewhat after the\n",
      "mam ner of human beings. A platform eight feet in height was erected in front of\n",
      "the Reptile House, and upon it were placed a table, a high chair such as small\n",
      "children use, and various dishes. To the platform a step-ladder led upward from\n",
      "the ground. Every day at four oâclock lusty Rajah was carried to the\n",
      "exhibition space, and set free upon the ground. Forthwith the keepers proceeded\n",
      "to dress him in trousers, vest, coat and cap. The moment the last button had\n",
      "been fastened and the cap placed upon his head, he would promptly walk to the\n",
      "ladder, climb up to the platform, and in the most business-like way imaginable,\n",
      "seat himself in his chair at the table, all ready to dine. He used a napkin, ate\n",
      "his soup with a spoon, speared and conveyed his sliced bananas with his fork,\n",
      "poured milk from a teapot into his teacup, and drank from his cup with great\n",
      "enjoyment and decorum. When he took a drink (of tea) from a suspicious-looking\n",
      "black bottle, the audience always laughed. When he elevated the empty bottle to\n",
      "one eye and looked far into it, they roared; and when he finally took a\n",
      "toothpick and gravely placed it in his mouth, his auditors were delighted.\n",
      "Several times during the progress of each meal, Rajah would pause and benignly\n",
      "gaze down upon the crowd, like a self- satisfied judge on his bench. Not once\n",
      "did Rajah spoil this exhibition, which was con- tinued throughout an entire\n",
      "summer, nor commit any overt act of impatience, indifference or meanness. The\n",
      "flighty, nervous temper of the chimpanzee was delightfully absent. The most\n",
      "remarkable feature of it all was his very evident enjoyment of his part of the\n",
      "performance, and his sense of responsibility to us and to his audiences. Rajah\n",
      "easily and quickly learned to ride a tricycle, and guide it himself. But for his\n",
      "untimely death, through a remarkable invasion of a microscopic parasite\n",
      "(Balentidium coli) imported from the Galapagos Islands by elephant tortoises,\n",
      "his mind would have been developed much farther. Since his death, in 1902, we\n",
      "have had other orang-utans that were successfully taught to dine, but none of\n",
      "them entered into the business with the same hearty zest which characterized\n",
      "Rajah, and made his performances so interesting. We now come to a consideration\n",

      "In three lessons he learned to ride a tricycle a very different character.\n",
      "Another male orang, named Dohong, of the same age and intellectual caste as\n",
      "Rajah, developed a faculty for mechanics and invention which not only challenged\n",
      "our admiration, but also created much work for our carpenters. He discovered, or\n",
      "invented, as you please, the lever as a mechanical force,âas fairly and\n",
      "squarely as Archimedes discovered the principle of the screw. Moreover, he\n",
      "delighted in the use of the new power thus acquired, quite as much as the\n",
      "successful inventor usually does. At the same time, two very bright chimpanzees\n",
      "of his own age, and with the same opportunities, discovered nothing. Dohong was\n",
      "of a reflective turn of mind, and never was entirely willing to learn the things\n",
      "that his keepers sought to teach him. To him, dining at a table was tiresomely\n",
      "dull, and the donning of fashionable clothing was a frivolous pastime. On the\n",
      "other hand, the interior of his cage, and his gymnastic appliances of ropes,\n",
      "trapeze and horizontal bars, all interested him greatly. Every square inch of\n",
      "surface, and every piece of material in his apartment, was carefully\n",
      "investigated, many times over. When three years old he discovered his own\n",
      "strength, and at first he used it good-naturedly to hector his cage-mate, a\n",
      "female chimpanzee smaller than himself. That, however, was of trifling interest.\n",
      "The day on which he made the discovery that he could break the wooden one and\n",
      "one-half inch horizontal bars that were held out from his cage walls on cast\n",
      "iron brackets, was for him a great day. Before his discovery was noted by the\n",
      "keepers he had joyfully destroyed two bars, and with a broken piece used as a\n",
      "lever was attacking a third. These bars were promptly replaced by larger bars,\n",
      "of harder wood, but screwed to the same cast-iron brackets that had carried the\n",
      "first series. For a time, the heavier bars endured; but in an evil moment the\n",
      "ape swung his trapeze bar, of two-inch oak, far over to one side of his cage,\n",
      "and applied the bar as a lever, inside of a horizontal bar and from above. The\n",
      "new force was too much for the cast-iron brackets, and one by one they gave way.\n",
      "Some were broken off, and others were torn from the wall by the breaking of the\n",
      "screws that held them. Knowing that all THE LEVER THAT OUR ORANG-UTAN INVENTED,\n",
      "AND THE WAY HE APPLIED IT By W. A. Camadeo, in the âScientific American,â\n",
      "1907 those brackets must be changed immediately, Dohong was left to destroy\n",
      "them; which he did, promptly and joyfully. We then made heavy brackets of flat\n",
      "wrought iron bars, yi by 2^ inches, unbreakable even with a lever. These were\n",
      "screwed on with screws so large and heavy that our carpenters knew they were\n",
      "quite secure. In due time, Dohong tested his lever upon the bars with their new\n",
      "brackets, and at first they held securely. Then he engaged Polly, his chimpanzee\n",
      "companion, to assist him to the limit of her strength. While Dohong pulled on\n",
      "the lever, Polly braced her absurd little back against the wall, and pushed upon\n",
      "it, with all her strength. At first nothing gave way. The com- bined strength\n",
      "exerted by the three brackets was not to be over- come by prying at the\n",
      "horizontal bar itself. It was then that Dohongâs inventive genius rose to its\n",
      "climax. He decided to attack the brackets singly, and conquer them one by one.\n",
      "On examining the situation very critically, he found that each bracket consisted\n",
      "of a right-angled triangle of wrought iron, with its perpendicular side against\n",
      "the wall, its base uppermost, and its hypotenuse out in the air. Through the\n",
      "open centre of the triangle he introduced the end of his trapeze bar, chain and\n",
      "all, as far as it would go, then gave a mighty heave. The end of his lever was\n",
      "against the wall, and the power was applied in such a manner that few machine\n",
      "screws could stand so great a strain. One by one, the screws were torn out of\n",
      "the wood, and finally each bracket worked upon was torn off. But there was one\n",
      "exception. The screws of one bracket were so firmly set in a particularly hard\n",
      "strip of the upright tongued-and-grooved yellow pine flooring that formed the\n",
      "wall, the board itself was finally torn out, full length! The board was four\n",
      "inches wide, seven-eighths of an inch thick, and seven feet long. Originally it\n",
      "was so firmly nailed that no one believed that it could be torn from its place.*\n",
      "Without delay, Dohong started in with his lever to pry off the remaining boards\n",
      "of the wall, but this movement was promptly checked. Our next task consisted in\n",
      "making long bolts by which the brackets of the horizontal bars were bolted\n",
      "entirely through the partition walls and held so powerfully on the other side\n",
      "that even the lever could not wreck them. As soon as the brackets were made\n",
      "secure, Dohong turned his attention to the two large sleeping boxes which were\n",
      "built very solidly on the balcony of his cage. Both of those struc- tures he\n",
      "tore completely to pieces,âalways working with the utmost good nature and\n",
      "cheerfulness. , Realizing that they * In the winter of 1921 about a dozen\n",
      "newspapers in the United States pub- lished a sensational syndicated article,\n",
      "occupying an entire page, in which all of Dohongâs lever discovery and\n",
      "cage-wrecking performances were reported as of recent occurrence, and credited\n",
      "to a stupid and uninteresting young orang called Gabong, now in the Zoological\n",

      "principles. could not exist in the cage with him, we gave him a permit to tear\n",
      "them outâand save the time of the carpenters. Dohongâs use of his lever was\n",
      "seen by hundreds of visitors, and one frequent visitor to the Park, Mr. L. A.\n",
      "Camacho, an engineer, was so much impressed that he published in the Scientific\n",
      "American an illustrated account of what he saw. For a long period, Dohong had\n",
      "been more or less annoyed by the fact that he could not get his head out between\n",
      "the front bars of his cage, and look around the partition into the home of his\n",
      "next-door neighbor. Very soon after he discovered the use of the lever, he swung\n",
      "his trapeze bar out to the upper corner of his cage, thrust the end of it out\n",
      "between the first bar and the steel column of the partition, and very deftly\n",
      "bent two of the iron bars outward far enough so that he could easily thrust his\n",
      "head outside and have his coveted look. One of our later and largest orangs made\n",
      "a specialty of twisting the straw of his bedding into a rope six or seven feet\n",
      "long, then throwing it over his trapeze bar and swinging by it, forward and\n",
      "back. Time and space will not permit the enumeration of the various things done\n",
      "by that ape of mechanical mind with his swinging rope and his trapeze, with\n",
      "ropes of straw twisted by himself, with keys, locks, hammer, nails and boxes.\n",
      "Any man who can witness such manifestations as those described above, and deny\n",
      "the existence in the animal of an ability to reason from cause to effect, must\n",
      "be prepared to deny the evi- dence of his own senses. The individual variations\n",
      "between orangs, as also between chimpanzees, are great and striking. It may with\n",
      "truth be said that no two individuals of either species are really quite alike\n",
      "in physiognomy, temperament and mental capacity. As subjects for the\n",
      "experimental psychologist, it is difficult to see how any other could be found\n",
      "that would be even a good second in living interest to the great apes. The facts\n",
      "thus far recorded, so I believe, present only a suggestion of the rich results\n",
      "that await the patient scientific investigator. In the year 1915 Dr. Robert M.\n",
      "Yerkes, of Harvard Uni- versity, conducted at Montecito, southern California, in\n",
      "a com- fortable primate laboratory, six months of continuous and dili- gent\n",
      "experiments on the behavior of orang-utans and monkeys. His report, published\n",
      "under the title of âThe Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational\n",
      "Behavior,â is a document of much interest and value. Dr. Yerkesâ use of the\n",
      "orang-utan as a subject was a decided step forward in the study of âanimal\n",
      "behaviorâ in America. IX THE MAN-LIKENESS OF THE CHIMPANZEE DURING the past\n",
      "twenty years, millions of thinking people have been startled, and not a few\n",
      "shocked, by the amazing and uncanny human-likeness of the performances of\n",
      "trained chimpanzees on the theatrical stage. Really, when a well trained\n",
      "âchimpâ is dressed from head to foot like a man, and is seen going with\n",
      "quickness, precision and spirit through a performance half an hour in length, we\n",
      "go away from it with an uncomfortable feeling that speech is all that he lacks\n",
      "of being a citizen. In 1904 the American public saw Esau. Next came Con-\n",
      "sul,âin about three or four separate editions! In 1909 we had Peter. Then came\n",
      "I know not how many more, including the giant Casey and Mr. Garnerâs Susie;\n",
      "and finally in 1918 our own Suzette. The theatre-going public has been well\n",
      "supplied with trained chimpanzees, and the mental capacity of that species is\n",
      "now more widely known and appreciated than that of any other wild animal except\n",
      "the Indian elephant. There are several reasons why chimpanzees predominate on\n",
      "the stage, and why so few performing orang-utans have been seen. They are as\n",
      "follows: 1. The orang is sanguine, and slower in execution than the nervous\n",
      "chimpanzee. 2. The feet of the orang are not good for shoes, and biped work. 3.\n",
      "The orang is rather awkward with its hands, and finally, 4. There are fully\n",
      "twice as many chimps in the market. But the chimpanzee has certain drawbacks of\n",
      "his own. His nervous temper and his forced-draught activities soon wear him out.\n",
      "If he survives to see his sixth or seventh year, it is then that he becomes so\n",
      "strong and so full of ego that he becomes dangerous and requires to be retired.\n",
      "Bright minds are more common among the chimpanzee species than among the orangs.\n",
      "Three chimps out of every five are good for training, but not more than two\n",
      "orangs out of five can be satisfactorily developed. Some sensitive minds shrink\n",
      "from the idea that man has âdescendedâ from the apes. I never for a moment\n",
      "shared that feeling. I would rather descend from a clean, capable and\n",
      "bright-minded genus of apes than from any unclean, ignorant and repulsive race\n",
      "of the genus Homo. In comparing the chim- panzees of Fernan Vaz with the Canoe\n",
      "Indians of the Strait of Magellan and other human tribes we could name, I think\n",
      "the former have decidedly the best of it. There are millions of members of the\n",
      "human race who are more loathsome and repulsive than wild apes. The face of the\n",
      "chimpanzee is highly mobile, and the mouth, lips, eyes and voice express the\n",
      "various emotions of the indi- vidual with a degree of clearness and precision\n",
      "second only to the facial expression of man himself. In fact, the face of an\n",
      "intelli- gent chimpanzee or orang-utan is a fairly constant index of the state\n",
      "of mind of the individual. In their turn, those enormously expansive lips and\n",
      "keen brown eyes express contentment, doubt, fear and terror; affection,\n",
      "disapproval, jealousy, anger, rage; hunger and satiety; lonesomeness and\n",
      "illness. The lips of the chimpanzee afford that animal several per- fectly\n",
      "distinct expressions of the individualâs mind and feelings. While it is not\n",
      "possible to offer a description of each which will certainly be recognizable to\n",
      "the reader, the two extremes will at least be appreciated. When coaxing for\n",
      "food, or attention, the lips are thrust far out beyond the teeth, and formed\n",
      "into a funnel with the small end outermost. When the chimpanzee flies into a\n",
      "rage at some real or fancied offense, the snarling lips are drawn back, and far\n",
      "up and down, until the teeth and gums are fully exposed in a ghastly threat of\n",
      "attack. At the same time, the voice gives forth shrill shrieks of rage,\n",
      "correctly rep- resented by the syllable âEe-ee-ee!â, prolonged, and repeated\n",
      "with great force, three or four times. On such occasions as the latter, the\n",
      "offending party must look out for himself, or he may be roughly handled. The\n",
      "voice of the chimpanzee is strong, clear, and in cap- tivity it is very much in\n",
      "evidence. Two of its moderate tones are almost musical. It is heard when the\n",
      "animal says, coax- ingly, âWho'-od! WW-oo!â A dozen times a day, our large\n",
      "specimens indulge in spells of loud yelling, purely for their own amusement.\n",
      "Their strident cry sounds like aHoo-hoo-hoo- hoo! Wah'-\\iob\\ Wati-hob\\ Hoo'-hoo!\n",
      "JTaMi-h-h! IEa^-h-h-h!â The second combination, âWah-hoo,â consists of two\n",
      "sounds, four notes apart. It is with their voices that chimpanzees first\n",
      "manifest their pleasure at seeing cherished friends of the human species, or\n",
      "their anger. Their recognition, and their exuberant joy on such occasions, is\n",
      "quite as apparent to every observer as are the manifestations of welcome of\n",
      "demonstrative human beings. Like all other groups of species, the apes of\n",
      "various genera now living vary widely in their mentalities. The chimpanzee has\n",
      "the most alert and human-like mind but with less speed the orang-utan is a good\n",
      "second. The average captive gorilla, if judged by existing standards for ape\n",
      "mentality, is a poor third in the anthropoid scale, below the chimp and orang;\n",
      "but since the rise of Major Pennyâs family-pet gorilla, named John, we must\n",
      "revise all our former views of that species, and concede exceptions. In studying\n",
      "the mental status of the primates I attach great importance to the work and\n",
      "results of the professional trainers who educate animals for stage performances.\n",
      "If the trainer does not know which are the brightest species of apes, baboons\n",
      "and monkeys, then who does? Their own fortunes depend upon their estimate of\n",
      "comparative mentality in the primates. PORTRAIT OF A HIGH-CASTE CPI1MPANZEE\n",

      "mimicry and are produced by imitation rather than by original thought, even\n",
      "their imitative work reveals a breadth of intelligence, a range of memory and of\n",
      "activity and precision in thought and in energy which no logical mind can\n",
      "ignore. To say that a chimpanzee who can swing through thirty or forty different\n",
      "acts âdoes not thinkâ and âdoes not reason,â is to deny the evidence of\n",
      "the human senses, and fall outside the bounds of human reason. Training Apec for\n",
      "Performances. As will appear in its own chapter, there is nothing at all\n",
      "mysterious in the training of apes. The subject must be young, and pliant in\n",
      "mind, and of cheerful and kind disposition. The poor subjects are left for cage\n",
      "life. The trainer must possess intelligence of good quality, infinite patience\n",
      "and tireless industry. Further- more, the stage properties must be ample. An\n",
      "outfit of this kind can train any ape that is mentally and physically a good\n",
      "subject. Of course in every animal species, wild or domestic, there are\n",
      "individuals so dull and stupid that it is inexpedient to try to educate them.\n",
      "The chimpanzee Suzette who came to us direct from the vaudeville stage performed\n",
      "every summer in her open-air âarena cage,â until she entered motherhood,\n",
      "which put an end to her stage work. She was a brilliant âtrickâ bicycle\n",
      "rider. She could stand upright on a huge wooden ball, and by expert balancing\n",
      "and foot-work roll it up a steep incline, down a flight of stairs, and land it\n",
      "safely upon the stage, without once losing her balance or her control. She was\n",
      "entirely at home on roller skates, and when taken out upon the pavement of Baird\n",
      "Court she would go wildly careering around the large grass plat at high speed.\n",
      "All the above acts were acrobatic feats that called for original thought and\n",
      "action, and were such as no dull mind and body could exert. All the training\n",
      "skill in the world could not take a machine and teach it to ride a bicycle\n",
      "through a collection of bottles, and an intelligent ape is a million years from\n",
      "being a âmachine in fur and feathers.â More than once I have been astounded\n",
      "by the performances of apes on the stage. Mr. J. S. Edwardsâ orang-utan Joe\n",
      "was a very capable animal, and his performances were wonder- ful. He could use a\n",
      "hammer in driving nails, and a screw- driver in inserting and extracting screws,\n",
      "with wonderful dexterity. The most remarkable chimpanzee performance that I ever\n",
      "saw was given in a New York theatre in 1909. The star actor was a fine male\n",
      "animal about six years old, called Peter. I made a complete record of his\n",
      "various acts, and the program was as follows Performance of Peter, a Chimpanzee\n",
      "Stage properties: a suit of clothes, shoes, chair, table, bed, bureau, hatrack,\n",
      "candle, cigarette, match, cuspidor, roller skates, bottles, flag, inclined plane\n",
      "and steps; plate, napkin, cup, spoon, teapot. As Peter entered, he bowed to the\n",
      "audience, took off his cap and hung it upon a hatrack. He went to the table,\n",
      "seated himself in the chair, unfolded and put on a napkin, and with a string\n",
      "fastened it in place under his chin. With a fork he speared some slices of\n",
      "banana and ate them. Into his tumbler he poured liquid from a bottle, drank,\n",
      "then corked the bottle. Next, he poured tea into a cup, put in sugar and cream,\n",
      "took tea from the spoon, then drank from the cup. After that he took a toothpick\n",
      "and used it elaborately. Striking a match he lit a cigarette, and smoked. In\n",
      "perfect man-fashion he took the cigarette between his fingers, gave his keeper a\n",
      "light, smoked again, and blew puffs of smoke first from one corner of his mouth\n",
      "and then the other. Then he elaborately spat into the cuspidor. Next in order he\n",
      "went to the bureau, cleaned his teeth with a tooth-brush, brushed his hair on\n",
      "both sides, looked into the mirror and powdered his face. Finally he bit a coin\n",
      "and put it on the keeperâs plate as a tip. He pulled off his coat, took off\n",
      "his cuffs and vest, and thus half undressed he joyously danced about, beating a\n",
      "tambourine. Then he removed his shirt, trousers, shoes, garters and socks.\n",
      "Lighting bis candle he walked to his bed, blew out the candle and went to bed.\n",
      "Very soon he rose, put on his trousers and a pair of roller skates and playfully\n",
      "pursued a young woman who ran before him. His use of the roller skates was\n",
      "excellent. The stage was cleared of furniture, and a bicycle was brought out. He\n",
      "mounted it and started off, at the first trial, and swiftly rode around the\n",
      "stage about fifteen times. While riding he took off his cap and waved it. He\n",
      "rode up an in- clined plane and down four steps without falling off, re- peating\n",
      "for an encore,âbut here he became peeved about something. Five bottles were\n",
      "set in a figure 8, and he rode between them several times. At last he took up a\n",
      "bottle and drank out of it. Then he drank out of a tumbler, all while riding.\n",
      "After much flag-waving and swift riding, Peter stopped at the center of the\n",
      "stage, dismounted, bowed, clapped his hands vigorously and retired. Peterâs\n",
      "performance was remarkable because of the great length of it, the absolute skill\n",
      "and precision of it, and the animalâs easy mastery of every situation. There\n",
      "was a notable absence of hesitations and mistakes, and of visible direction. The\n",
      "trainer seemed to do nothing save to assist with the stage properties, just as\n",
      "an assistant helps any acrobat through the property business of his act. If any\n",
      "commands or signs were given, the audience was not aware of it. Later on I\n",
      "learned that sometimes Peter did not perform with such spirit, and required some\n",
      "urging to be prompt. The trainer was kept hustling to keep up with his own\n",
      "duties. The animal seemed to remember, and I believe he did remember, the\n",
      "sequence of a performance of fifty-six separate acts! When I witnessed Peterâs\n",
      "performance in New York, saw the length of it and noted the immense amount of\n",
      "ner- vous energy that each performance used up, I made the prediction that he\n",
      "could not for one year endure such a strain. It was reported to me that he died\n",
      "nine months from that time. In October, 1909, when Peter went to Philadelphia,\n",
      "he was frequently and closely studied and observed by Dr. Lightner Witmer,\n",
      "professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, and his mentality was\n",
      "tested at the laboratory of the University. Dr. Witmerâs conclusions, as set\n",
      "forth in a paper in the December (1909) issue of the Psychological Clinic, are\n",
      "of very great interest. He approached Peterâs first performance in a skeptical\n",
      "frame of mind. I gladly waive the opportunity to express my own views regarding\n",
      "Peter in order to put upon the stand a more competent witness. Hear Dr. Witmer:\n",
      "âAs I entered the theatre,â he says, âmy feelings were commingled interest\n",
      "and doubt. My doubts were bred from knowledge of the difficulty of judging the\n",
      "intelligence of an animal from a stage performance. So-called educated horses\n",
      "and even educated seals and fleas have made their appeal in large number to the\n",
      "credulity of the public. Can any animal below man be educated in the proper\n",
      "sense of the word? Or is the animal mind susceptible of nothing more than a\n",
      "mechan- ical training, and only given the specious counterfeit of an educated\n",
      "intelligence when under the direct control of the trainer? âSince that day I\n",
      "have seen Peter in five public perform- ances, have tested him at my\n",
      "psychological clinic and privately on three occasions. I now believe that in a\n",
      "very real sense the animal is himself giving the stage performance. He knows\n",
      "what he is doing, he delights in it, he varies it from time to time, he\n",
      "understands the succession of tricks which are being called for, he is guided by\n",
      "word of mouth without any signal open or concealed, and the function of his\n",
      "trainer is exercised mainly to steady and control. âI am prepared to accept\n",
      "the statement of his trainers, Mr. and Mrs. McArdle, that Peterâs proficiency\n",
      "is not so much the result of training as of downright self-education.â Peter\n",
      "was put through many of the tests which Dr. Witmer uses for the study of\n",
      "backward children. He performed many of these tests in a very satisfactory\n",
      "manner. He was able to string beads the first time he tried it. He put pegs in\n",
      "the ordinary kindergarten pegging board. He opened and closed a very difficult\n",
      "lock. He used hammer and screw driver, and distinguished without any mistake\n",
      "between nails and screws. A peculiar kind of hammer was given to him in order to\n",
      "fool him, but Peter was not fooled. He felt both ends of the hammer and used the\n",
      "flat end instead of the round end. Showing his initiative during the tests,\n",
      "Peter got away from those who were watching him and darted for a washstand,\n",
      "quickly turned the faucet and put his mouth to the spigot and secured a drink\n",
      "before he was snatched away by his trainers. He understood language and followed\n",
      "instructions without signs. He was able to say âmamma,â and Doctor Witmer\n",
      "taught him. in five minutes to give the sound of âp.â The most remarkable\n",
      "performance was making the letter âwâ on the blackboard, in which he\n",
      "imitated Doctor Witmerâs move- ments exactly, and reproduced a fair copy of\n",
      "the letter.. The last four paragraphs reproduced above have been copied from an\n",
      "article which appeared in the Philadelphia Public Ledger on December 17, 1909.\n",
      "Dr. Witmer declares that the study of this apeâs mind is a subject fit, not\n",
      "for the animal psychologist, but for the child psychologist. Suzetteâs Failure\n",
      "in Maternal Instinct. As a closing contribution to our observations on the\n",
      "chimpanzee, I must record a tragic failure in maternal instinct, as well as in\n",
      "general intelligence, in a chimpanzee. In 1919 our two fine eight-year old\n",
      "chimpanzees, Boma and Suzette, were happily married. It was a genuine love\n",
      "match, and strictly monogamous at that; for while big Fanny Chimp in the cage\n",
      "next door to Boma loved Boma and openly courted him, he was outrageously\n",
      "indifferent to her, and even scorned her. After seven months of gestation, a\n",
      "very good baby was born to Suzette, quite naturally and successfully. Bomaâs\n",
      "shouts of excitement and delight carried half a mile throughout the Park.\n",
      "Everything looked most auspicious for the rearing of a wonder- ful cage-bred and\n",
      "cage-born chimpanzee, the second one ever born in captivity. Instead of carrying\n",
      "her infant astride her hip, as do orang mothers, and the coolie women of India,\n",
      "Suzette astonished us beyond measure by tucking it into her groin, between her\n",
      "thigh and her abdomen, head outward. It was a fine place,â warm and\n",
      "soft,âbut not good when overdone! When Suzette walked, as she freely did, she\n",
      "held up the leg responsible for the baby, to hold it securely in place, and\n",
      "walked upon the other foot and her two hands. About all this there was one very\n",
      "bad thing. The baby was perfectly helpless! As long as the mother chose to keep\n",
      "it in her groin prison, it could not get free. Suzette was completely isolated,\n",
      "kept absolutely quiet, and every chance was given her to go on with the\n",
      "functions of motherhood. Her breasts contained plenty of milk, and the flow was\n",
      "due to start on the second day after the infantâs arrival. Day and night the\n",
      "baby was jealously confined in that massive and powerful groin,âand under too\n",
      "much pressure! When the baby cried, and kicked, and struggled to get free,\n",
      "Suzette would nervously rearrange her straw bed, carefully pick from the tiny\n",
      "fingers every straw that they had clutched, and settle down again. If the\n",
      "struggle was soon renewed, Suzette would change the infant over to the other\n",
      "groin, and close upon it as before. Sleeping or waking, walking, sitting or\n",
      "lying down, she held it there. If we attempted to touch the infant, the mother\n",
      "instantly became savage and dangerous. Not one human finger was permitted to\n",
      "touch it. For hours, and for days, we anxiously watched for nursing to begin;\n",
      "but in vain. At last we became almost frantic from the spectacle of the infant\n",
      "being slowly starved to death because the mother did not realize that it needed\n",
      "her milk, and that she alone could promote nursing. Her mother instinct utterly\n",
      "failed to supply the link that alone could connect infancy to motherhood, and\n",
      "furnish life. Of course this failure was due to poor Suzetteâs artificial\n",
      "life, and unnatural surroundings. Had she been all alone, in the depths of a\n",
      "tropical forest, Nature would have proceeded along her usual lines. But in our\n",
      "Primate House, Suzette felt that her infant was surrounded by a host of strange\n",
      "enemies, from whom it must be strongly and persistently guarded and defended.\n",
      "That was the idea that completely dominated her mind, ruled out all human help,\n",
      "and blocked the main process of nature. During the eight days that the infant\n",
      "lived, it was able to reach her breast and nurse only once, for about one\n",
      "minute; and then back it went to its prison, where it died from sheer lack of\n",
      "nourishment. In 1920, that same history was repeated, except that on this\n",
      "occasion our Veterinary Surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair, worked (on the fifth day)\n",
      "for seven hours without intermission to stupefy Suzette with chloroform, or\n",
      "other opiates, sufficiently to make it possible to remove the baby without a\n",
      "fight with the mother and its certain death. Owing to her savage temper all the\n",
      "work had to be done between iron bars, to keep from losing hands or arms, and\n",
      "the handicap on the human hand was too great. Even when Suzette had received\n",
      "chloroform for an hour and twenty minutes, and was regarded as half dead, at the\n",
      "first touch of a human finger upon her thigh she instantly aroused and sprang\n",
      "up, raging and ready for battle. The whole effort failed. To rope Suzette and\n",
      "attempt to control her by force would have been sheer folly, or worse. In such a\n",
      "struggle the infant would have been torn to pieces. The second one died as the\n",
      "first one did, and for an awful week we were unable to gain possession of the\n",
      "decomposing cadaver. Suzette knew that something was wrong, and she realized the\n",
      "awful odor, but that idea of defense of her off- spring obscured all others. In\n",
      "maintaining her possession of that infant, nothing could surpass the cunning of\n",
      "that ape mother. Will we ever succeed in outwitting her, and in getting one of\n",
      "her babies alive into a baby incubator? Who can say? X THE TRUE MENTAL STATUS OF\n",
      "THE GORILLA THE true mental status of the gorilla was discovered in 1919 and\n",
      "1920, at 15 Sloane Street, London, by Major Rupert Penny, of the Royal Air\n",
      "Service, and his young relative, Miss Alyse Cunningham. Prior to that time,\n",
      "through various combinations of retarding circumstances, no living gorilla had\n",
      "ever been placed and kept in an environment calcu- lated to develop and display\n",
      "the real mental calibre of the gorilla mind. It seems that an exhibition cage,\n",
      "in a zoological park or garden thronged with visitors, actually tends to the\n",
      "suppres- sion, or even the complete extinguishment, of true gorilla character.\n",
      "The atmosphere of the footlights and the stage in which the chimpanzee delights\n",
      "and thrives is to the gorilla repulsive and unbearable. Judging by Major\n",
      "Pennyâs â John,â the gorilla wishes to live in a high-class human family,\n",
      "in a modern house, and be treated like a human being! It is now definitely\n",
      "recognized by us, and also by our colleagues in the London Zoological Gardens,\n",
      "that gorillas can not live long and thrive on public exhibition, before great\n",
      "crowds of people, and that it is folly to insist upon trying to compel them to\n",
      "do so. The male individual that lived several years in the Breslau Zoological\n",
      "Garden and attained the age of seven years was a striking exception. We have had\n",
      "two gorillas at our Park, one of which, a female named Dinah, arrived in good\n",
      "health, and lived with us eleven and one-half months. Her mind was dull and\n",
      "hopelessly unresponsive. She learned next to nothing, and she did nothing really\n",
      "interesting. Other captive gorillas I have known have been equally morose and\n",
      "unresponsive, and lived fewer months than Dinah. It is because of such animals\n",
      "as Dinah that for fifty years the mental status of the gorilla species has been\n",
      "under a cloud. Until now it has been much misunderstood and unappreciated. Of\n",
      "the few gorillas that have been seen in England and America, I think that all\n",
      "save John have been so morose and unrespon- sive, and so undeveloped by\n",
      "companionship and training, that mentally they have been rated far below the\n",
      "chimpanzee and orang. Our own Dinah was no exception to the rule. Personally she\n",
      "was a stupid little thing, even when in excellent health. Her most pronounced\n",
      "and exasperating stupidities were shown in her refusal to eat, or to taste,\n",
      "strange food, even when very hungry. Any ape that does not know enough to eat a\n",
      "fine, ripe banana, and will only mince away at the inner lining of the banana\n",
      "skin, is an unmitigated numskull, and hardly fit to live. Dinah was all that,\n",
      "and more. But, alas! We have seen a few stupid human children who obstinately\n",
      "refused even to taste certain new and unknown kinds of food, because they\n",
      "âknowâ they will not like them! So Dinah was not alone in her childish\n",
      "folly. At last a chain of circumstances placed an intellectual and sensible\n",
      "gorilla, two years of age, in the hands of a family specially fitted by\n",
      "education and home surroundings to develop its mind and its manners. The results\n",
      "of those efforts have given to the gorilla an entirely new mental status. Thanks\n",
      "to the enterprise and diligence of Major Rupert Penny and Miss Cunningham in\n",
      "purchasing and caring for a sick and miserable young male gorilla,âa most\n",
      "hazardous risk,âa new chapter in wild-animal psychology now is to be written.\n",
      "In December, 1918, âJohn Gorillaâ was purchased in a London department\n",
      "store, out of a daily atmosphere heated to 85 degrees, and a nightly condition\n",
      "of solitude and terror. From that awful state it was taken to live in Major\n",
      "Penny's comfortable apartments. John was seriously ill. He was in a\n",
      "âricketyâ condition, and he weighed only 32 pounds. With a pure atmosphere,\n",
      "kept at 65 degrees only, and amid good sur- roundings, he soon became well. He\n",
      "attained such robust health and buoyant spirits that in March, 1921, he stood\n",
      "40% inches high and weighed 112 pounds. At my solicitation Miss Cunningham wrote\n",
      "out for me the very remarkable personal history of that wonderful animal,â\n",
      "apparently the most wonderful gorilla ever observed in cap- tivity. It is a\n",
      "clear, straightforward and convincing record, and not one of its statements is\n",
      "to be for one moment doubted. While it is too long to reproduce here in its\n",
      "entirety, I will present a condensation of it, in Miss Cunninghamâs own words\n",
      "that will record the salient facts,âwith no changes save in arrangement. Miss\n",
      "Cunningham says: Loneliness. âWe soon found it was impossible to leave him\n",
      "alone at night, because he shrieked every night, and nearly all night, from\n",
      "loneliness and fear. This we found he had done in the store where he lived\n",
      "before coming to us. He always began to cry directly he saw the assistants\n",
      "putting things away for the night. We found that this loneliness at night was\n",
      "trying on his health and appetite. As soon as possible my nephew had his bed\n",
      "made up every night in the room adjoining the cage, with the result that John\n",
      "was quite happy, and began to grow and put on fat. Treatment. â I fed him,\n",
      "washed his hands, face and feet twice a day, and brushed and combed his\n",
      "hair,âwhich he would try to do himself whenever he got hold of the brush or\n",
      "comb. He soon got to like all this. Training. âMy next idea was to teach him\n",
      "to be strictly clean in his habits. It was my ambition to be able to have him\n",
      "upstairs in our house as an ordinary member of the household. I taught him first\n",
      "as a child is taught and handled. This took some time. At first I could not make\n",
      "him understand what we expected of him, even though I always petted him and gave\n",
      "him grapes (of which he was especially fond), but I think at first he imagined\n",
      "that this treatment was a punishment. At first, without other reasons, he would\n",
      "roll on the floor and shriek, but directly he understood what was expected of\n",
      "him he soon learned, and began to behave excellently. âThis training occupied\n",
      "quite six weeks. About February, 1919, we took him out of his cage, and allowed\n",
      "him the freedom of the house. Thereafter he would run upstairs to the bath- room\n",
      "of his own accord, turning the doorknob of whatever room he was in, and also\n",
      "opening the door of the bathroom. . . . He would get out of bed in the night by\n",
      "himself, go back to bed, and pull the blankets over himself quite neatly. Food,\n",
      "âJohnâs appetite seemed to tire of foods very quickly. The only thing he\n",
      "stuck to was milk, which he liked best when warmed. We began by giving him a\n",
      "quart a day, rising to three and one-half quarts a day. I found that he\n",
      "preferred to choose his own food, so I used to prepare for him several kinds,\n",
      "such as bananas, oranges, apples, grapes, raisins, currants, dates and any small\n",
      "fruits in season, such as rasp- berries or strawberries, all of which he liked\n",
      "to have warmed! âThese displays I placed on a high shelf in the kitchen, where\n",
      "he could get them with difficulty. I think that he thought himself very clever\n",
      "when he stole anything. He never would eat anything stale. He was extremely fond\n",
      "of fresh lemon jelly, but he never would touch it after the second day. He loved\n",
      "roses, to eat, more than anything. The more beautiful they were, the more he\n",
      "liked them, but he never would eat faded roses. He never cared much for nuts of\n",
      "any other kind than baked peanuts, save walnuts. I found that nuts gave him\n",
      "dreadful spells of indigestion. Use of Tools. â He knew what hammers and\n",
      "chisels were for, but for obvious reasons we never encouraged him in any- thing\n",
      "to do with carpentry. With cocoanuts he was very funny. He knew that they had to\n",
      "be broken, and he would try to break them on the floor. When he found he\n",
      "couldnât manage that, he would bring the nut to one of us and try to make us\n",
      "understand what he wished. If we gave him a ham- mer he would try to use it on\n",
      "the nut, and on not being able to manage that, he would give back to us both the\n",
      "hammer and the cocoanut. Games and Play. âWe never taught him any tricks; he\n",
      "simply acquired knowledge himself. A game he was very fond of was to pretend he\n",
      "was blind, shutting his eyes very tightly, and running around the room knocking\n",
      "against tables and chairs. ... We found that exercise was the thing he required\n",
      "to keep him in health, and my nephew used to give him plenty of that by playing\n",
      "hide and seek with him in the morning before breakfast, and in the evening\n",
      "before dinner,âup and down stairs, in and out of all the rooms. He simply\n",
      "loved that game, and would giggle and laugh while being chased. . . . If he saw\n",
      "that a stranger was at all nervous about him, he loved running past him, and\n",
      "giving him a smack on the leg,âand you could see him grin as he did so. âA\n",
      "thing he greatly enjoyed was to stand on the top rail of his bed and jump on the\n",
      "springs, head over heels, just like a child. Caution. âHe was very cautious.\n",
      "He would never run into a dark room without first turning on the light. Fear.\n",
      "âJohn seemed to realize danger for other people in high places, for if anyone\n",
      "looked out of a high window he always pushed them away if he were at the window\n",
      "himself, but if he was away from it he would run and pull them back. . . . He\n",
      "was very much afraid of full-grown sheep, cows and horses, but he loved colts,\n",
      "calves and lambs, proving to us that he recognized youth. Woods vs. Fields.\n",
      "âWe found he did not like fields or open country, but he was very happy in a\n",
      "garden, or in woods. ... He always liked nibbling twigs, and to eat the green\n",
      "buds of trees. Table Manners. â His table manners were really very good. He\n",
      "always sat at the table, and whenever a meal was ready, would pull his own chair\n",
      "up to his place. He did not care to eat a great deal, but he especially liked to\n",
      "drink water out of a tumbler. . . . He was the least greedy of all the animals I\n",
      "have ever seen. He never would snatch anything, and always ate very slowly. He\n",
      "always drank a lot of water, which he would always get himself whenever he\n",
      "wanted it by turning on a tap. Strange to say, he always turned off the water\n",
      "when he had finished drinking. Playing to the Gallery. âJohn seemed to think\n",
      "that everyone was delighted to see him, and he would throw up the window\n",
      "whenever he was permitted. If he found the sash locked he would unfasten it, and\n",
      "when a big crowd had collected outside he would clap his chest and his hands.*\n",
      "Punishment and Repentance. âWe made one very great mistake with John. His cage\n",
      "was used as a punishment, with the result that we never could leave him there\n",
      "alone, for he would shriek all the time. . . . Now, a stick was the one thing\n",
      "that our gorilla would not stand from anyone, save Major Penny and myself.\n",
      "Presently we found out that the only way to deal with him was to tell him that\n",
      "he was very naughty, and push him away from us; when he would roll on the floor\n",
      "and cry, and be very repentant, holding oneâs ankles, and putting his head on\n",
      "our feet. Affection for a Child. âHe was especially fond of my little niece,\n",
      "three years old. John and she used to play together for hours, and he seemed to\n",
      "understand what she wanted him to do. If she ever cried, and her mother would\n",
      "not go and pick her up, John would always try and nip the mother, or give her a\n",
      "smack with the full weight of his hand, evidently thinking she was the cause of\n",
      "the childâs tears. A Sense of Good Order. âHe loved to take everything *In\n",
      "the summer of 1920 a globe-trotter just arrived from England excitedly reported\n",
      "to me: âWhile driving along a street in London I saw a live gorilla in the\n",
      "upper window of an apart- ment. It was a real gorilla; and it clapped its hands\n",
      "at us as we looked! Now what did it all mean?â Fortunately I was able to\n",
      "explain it. THE GORILLA WITH THE WONDEREUL MIND Owned by Major Rupert Penny,\n",
      "educated by Miss Alyse Cunningham, London, 1918-1921 out of a wastepaper basket\n",
      "and strew the contents all over the room, after which, when told to do so he\n",
      "would pick up every- thing and put it all back, but looking very bored all the\n",
      "while. If the basket was very full he would push it all down very carefully, to\n",
      "make room for more. He would always put things back when told to do so, such as\n",
      "books from a bookshelf or things from a table. Two Cases of Original Thought,\n",
      "(i) âOne day we were going out, for which I was sitting ready dressed, when\n",
      "John wished to sit in my lap. My sister, Mrs. Penny, said: âDonât let him.\n",
      "He will spoil your dress.â âAs my dress happened to be a light one I pushed\n",
      "him away, and said, âNo!â He at once lay on the floor and cried just like a\n",
      "child, for about a minute. Then he rose, looked round the room, found a\n",
      "newspaper, went and picked it up, spread it on my lap and climbed up. This was\n",
      "quite the cleverest thing I ever saw him do. Even those who saw it said they\n",
      "would not have believed it had they not seen it themselves! Both my nephews,\n",
      "(Major Penny and Mr. E. C. Penny), his wife and my sister (Mrs. Penny) were in\n",
      "the room, and can testify to the correct- ness of the above record. (2) â\n",
      "Another clever thing John did, although I suspect this was due more to instinct\n",
      "that to downright cleverness. A piece of filet beefsteak had just come from the\n",
      "butcher. Inasmuch as occasionally I gave him a small mouthful of raw beef, a\n",
      "small piece of the coarser part of the steak was cut off, and I gave it to him.\n",
      "He tasted it, then gravely handed it back to me. Then he took my hand and put it\n",
      "on the finer part of the meat. From that I cut off a tiny piece, gave it to him,\n",
      "and he ate it. When my nephew came home he wouldnât believe it, so I tried it\n",
      "again, with the same result, except that then he did not even attempt to eat the\n",
      "coarser meat.â Â«â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ â¢ Concerning Miss Cunninghamâs wonderful\n",
      "story, I wish to state that I believe all of it,âbecause there is no reason to\n",
      "do otherwise! It sets a new mark in gorilla lore, and it lifts a curtain from an\n",
      "animal mind that previously was unknown, and very generally misunderstood. To\n",
      "the Doubting Thomases who will doubt some portions of Miss Cunninghamâs story,\n",
      "let me cite, by way of caution, the following history: When Du Chaillu\n",
      "discovered the gorilla, and came to America and England with his specimens to\n",
      "tell about it, he said that when a big gorilla is attacked and made angry it\n",
      "beats its breast, repeatedly, with its clenched fists. The wise- acres of that\n",
      "day solemnly shook their heads and said: âOb, no! That can not be true. No ape\n",
      "ever did that. He is romancing!â But now we know that this breast-beating and\n",
      "chest-clapping habit is to a gorilla a common-place performance, even in\n",
      "captivity. Sometimes there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt\n",
      "of in all our philosophy. XI THE MIND OF THE ELEPHANT IT was in the jungles of\n",
      "the Animallai Hills of southern India that I first became impressed by the\n",
      "mental capacity of the Indian elephant. I saw many wild herds. I saw elephants\n",
      "at work, and at one period I lived in a timber camp, consisting of working\n",
      "elephants and mahouts. I saw a shrewd young elephant-driver soundly flogged for\n",
      "stealing an elephant, farming it out to a native timber contractor for four\n",
      "days, and then elaborately pretending that the animal had been âlost.â Later\n",
      "on I saw elephant performances in the â Greatest Show on Earthâ and\n",
      "elsewhere, and for eighteen years I have been chief mourner over the\n",
      "idiosyncrasies of Gunda and Alice. If I do not now know something about\n",
      "elephants, then my own case of animal intelligence is indeed hopeless. To me it\n",
      "seems that the only thing necessary to establish the elephant as an animal of\n",
      "remarkable intellect and power of original reasoning is to set forth the\n",
      "unadorned facts that lie ready to hand. Cuvier recorded the opinion that in\n",
      "sagacity the elephant in no way excels the dog and some other species of\n",
      "carnivora. Sir Emerson Tennent, even after some study of the elephant, was\n",
      "disposed to award the palm for intelligence to the dog, but only âfrom the\n",
      "higher degree of development consequent on his more intimate domestication and\n",
      "association with man.â In the mind of G. P. Sanderson we fear that familiarity\n",
      "with the elephant bred a measure of contempt; and this seems very strange. He\n",
      "says: âIts reasoning faculties are undoubtedly far below those of 10? the dog,\n",
      "and possibly of other animals; and in matters beyond its daily experience it\n",
      "evinces no special discernment.,, To me it seems that all three of those\n",
      "opinions are off the target. The dog is not a wild, untrammeled animal; and\n",
      "neither dogs, cats nor savage men evince any special discernment âbeyond the\n",
      "range of their daily experience.â Moreover, there are some millions of tame\n",
      "men of whom the same may be said with entire safety. Very often the question is\n",
      "asked: âIs the African elephant equal in intelligence and training capacity to\n",
      "the Indian species?â To this we must answer: Not proven. We do not know. The\n",
      "African species never has been tried out on the same long and wide basis as the\n",
      "Indian. Many individual African elephants, very intelligent, have been trained,\n",
      "successfully, and have given good accounts of themselves. For my own part I am\n",
      "absolutely sure that when taken in hand at the same age, and trained on the same\n",
      "basis as the Indian species, the African elephant will be found mentally quite\n",
      "the equal of the Indian, and just as available for work or performances. No\n",
      "negro tribe really likes to handle elephants and train them. The Indian native\n",
      "loves elephants, and enjoys training them and working with them. It is these two\n",
      "conditions that have left the African elephant far behind the procession. The\n",
      "African elephant belongs to the great Undeveloped Continent. He has been, and he\n",
      "still is, mercilessly pursued and slaughtered for his tusks. All the existing\n",
      "species of African elephants are going down and out before the ivory hunters. We\n",
      "fear that they will all be dead one hundred years from this time, or even less.\n",
      "A century hence,âwhen the last ajricanus has gone to join the mammoth and the\n",
      "mastodon, his well protected wild congener in India still will be devouring his\n",
      "four hundred pounds of green fodder per day, and the tame ones will be\n",
      "performing to amuse the swarming human millions of this overcrowded world. In\n",
      "the minds of our elephant keepers, familiarity with ele- phants has bred just\n",
      "the reverse of contempt. Both Thuman and Richards are quite sure that elephants\n",
      "are the wisest of all wild animals. Despite the very great amount of trouble\n",
      "made for Keeper Thuman by Gunda, the Indian, and Kartoum, the African, Thuman\n",
      "grows enthusiastic over the shrewdness of their âcussedness.â He is\n",
      "particularly impressed by their skill in opening chain shackles, and unfastening\n",
      "the catches and locks of doors and gates. And really, Kartoumâs ingenuity in\n",
      "finding out how to open latches and bolts is almost inexhaustible, as well as\n",
      "marvelous. Keeper Richards declares that our late African pygmy elephant, Congo,\n",
      "was the wisest animal he ever has known. I have elsewhere referred to his\n",
      "ability in shutting his outside door. Richards taught him to accept coins from\n",
      "visitors, deposit them in a box, then pull a cord to ring a bell, one pull for\n",
      "each coin represented. The keeper devised four different systems of intimate\n",
      "signals by which he could tell Congo to stop at the right point, and all these\n",
      "were so slight that no one ever detected them. One was by a voice-given cue,\n",
      "another by a hand motion, and a third was by an inclination of the body. Keeper\n",
      "Richards relates that Congo would go out in his yard, collect a trunkful of\n",
      "peanuts from visitors, bring them inside and secretly cache them in a corner\n",
      "behind his feed box. Then he would go out for more graft peanuts, bring them in,\n",
      "hide them and proceed to eat the first lot. There are millions of men who do not\n",
      "know what it is to conserve something that can be eaten. In this discussion of\n",
      "the intellectual powers and moral qualities of the elephant I will confine\n",
      "myself to my own obser- vations on Elephas indicus, except where otherwise\n",
      "stated. A point to which we ask special attention is that in endeavoring to\n",
      "estimate the mental capacity of the elephant, we will base no general\n",
      "conclusions upon any particularly intelligent indi- vidual, as all mankind is\n",
      "tempted to do in discussions of the intelligence of the dog, the cat, the horse,\n",
      "parrot and ape. On the contrary, it is our desire to reveal the mental capacity\n",
      "of every elephant living, tame or wild, except the few individuals with abnormal\n",
      "or diseased minds. It is not to be shown how successfully an elephant has been\n",
      "taught by man, but how all elephants in captivity have been taught, and the\n",
      "mental capac- ity of every elephant. Under the head of intellectual qualities we\n",
      "have first to consider the elephantâs Powers of Independent Observations, and\n",
      "Reasoning from Cause to Effect While many wonderful stories are related of the\n",
      "elephantâs sagacity and independent powers of reasoning, it must be admitted\n",
      "that a greater number of more wonderful anecdotes are told on equally good\n",
      "authority of dogs. But the circum- stances in the case are wholly to the\n",
      "advantage of the universal dog, and against the rarely seen elephant. While the\n",
      "former roams at will through his masterâs premises, through town and country,\n",
      "mingling freely with all kinds of men and domestic animals, with unlimited time\n",
      "to lay plans and execute them, the elephant in captivity is chained to a stake,\n",
      "with no liberty of action whatever aside from begging with his trunk, eating and\n",
      "drinking. His only amusement is in swaying his body, swing- ing one foot,\n",
      "switching his tail, and (in a zoological park) looking for something that he can\n",
      "open or destroy. Such a ponderous beast cannot be allowed to roam at large among\n",
      "human beings, and the working elephant never leaves his stake and chain except\n",
      "under the guidance of his mahout. There is no means of estimating the wonderful\n",
      "powers of reasoning that captive elephants might develop if they could only\n",
      "enjoy the freedom accorded to all dogs except the blood-hound, bull-dog and a\n",
      "few others. In the jungles of India the writer frequently has seen wild\n",
      "elephants reconnoitre dangerous ground by means of a scout or spy; communicate\n",
      "intelligence by signs; retreat in orderly silence from a lurking danger, and\n",
      "systematically march, in single file, like the jungle tribes of men. Once having\n",
      "approached to within fifty yards of the strag- glers of a herd of about thirty\n",
      "wild elephants, which was scat- tered over about four acres of very open forest\n",
      "and quietly feeding, two individuals of the herd on the side nearest us sud-\n",
      "denly suspected danger. One of them elevated his trunk, with the tip bent\n",
      "forward, and smelled the air from various points of the compass. A moment later\n",
      "an old elephant left the herd and started straight for our ambush, scenting the\n",
      "air with upraised trunk as he slowly and noiselessly advanced. We instantly\n",
      "retreated, unobserved and unheard. The elephant advanced until he reached the\n",
      "identical spot where we had a moment before been concealed. He paused, and stood\n",
      "motion- less as a statue for about two minutes, then wheeled about and quickly\n",
      "but noiselessly rejoined the herd. In less than half a minute the whole herd was\n",
      "in motion, heading directly away from us, and moving very rapidly, but without\n",
      "the slightest noise. The huge animals simply vanished like shadows into the\n",
      "leafy depths of the forest. Before proceeding a quarter of a mile, the entire\n",
      "herd formed in single file and continued strictly in that order for several\n",
      "miles. Like the human dwellers in the jungle, the elephants know that the\n",
      "easiest and most expeditious way for a large body of animals to traverse a\n",
      "tangled forest is for the leader to pick the way, while all the others follow in\n",
      "his foot- steps. In strong contrast with the stealthy and noiseless manner in\n",
      "which elephants steal away from a lurking danger, or an ambush discovered, from\n",
      "an open attack accompanied with the noise of fire-arms they rush away at\n",
      "headlong speed, quite regardless of the noise they make. On one occasion a herd\n",
      "which I was designing to attack, and had approached to within forty yards, as\n",
      "its members were feeding in some thick bushes, discovered my presence and\n",
      "retreated so silently that they had been gone five minutes before I discovered\n",
      "what their sudden quietude really meant. In this instance, as in several others,\n",
      "the still alarm was communicated by silent signals, or sign-language. At the\n",
      "Zoological Park we reared an African pygmy elephant (Elephas pumilio). When his\n",
      "slender little tusks grew to eighteen inches in length he made some interesting\n",
      "uses of them. Once when the keepers wished to lead him upon our large plat- form\n",
      "scales, the trembling of the platform frightened him. He conceived the idea that\n",
      "it was unsafe, and therefore that he must keep off. He backed away, halted, and\n",
      "refused to leave solid ground. The men pushed him. He backed, and trump- eted a\n",
      "shrill protest. The men pushed harder, and forced him forward. Trumpeting his\n",
      "wild alarm and his protest against what he regarded as murder, he fell upon his\n",
      "knees and drove his tusks into the earth, quite up to his mouth, to anchor him-\n",
      "self firmly to the solid ground. It was pathetic, but also amusing. When Congo\n",
      "finally was pushed upon the scales and weighed, he left the trembling instrument\n",
      "of torture with an air of disgust and disapproval that was quite as eloquent as\n",
      "words. On several occasions when taken out for exercise in the park, he\n",
      "endeavored to hinder the return to quarters by anchoring himself to Mother\n",
      "Earth. Congo once startled us by his knowledge of the usefulness of doors. For a\n",
      "time he was kept in a compartment that had an outside door running sidewise on a\n",
      "trolley track, and controlled by two hanging chains, one to close it and one to\n",
      "open it. Each chain had on its end a stout iron ring for a handle. One chilly\n",
      "morning when I went to see Congo, I asked his keeper to open his door, so that\n",
      "he could go out. The keeper did so, by pulling the right hand chain. The moment\n",
      "the draft of chilly outer air struck Congo, who stood in the centre of his stall\n",
      "facing me, he impatiently wheeled about, walked up to the left hand chain,\n",
      "grabbed it with his trunk, slipped the ring over one of his tusks, then inclined\n",
      "his head downward and with an irritated tug pulled the door shut with a spiteful\n",
      "slam. âOpen it again,â I said to the keeper. He did so, and in the same way,\n",
      "but with a visible increase in irritation, Congo closed it in the same manner as\n",
      "before. Again the keeper opened the door, and this time, with a real exhibition\n",
      "of temper Congo again thrust the ring over his tusk, and brought the door shut\n",
      "with a resounding bang. It was his regular habit to close that door, or to open\n",
      "it, when he felt like more air or less air; and who is there who will say that\n",
      "the act was due to âinstinctâ in a jungle-bred animal, or anything else than\n",
      "original thought. The ring on his tusk was his own inven- tion, as a means to a\n",
      "desired end. Every elephant that we ever have had has become, through his own\n",
      "initiative and experimenting, an expert in unfastening the latches of doors and\n",
      "gates, and in untying chains and ropes. Gunda always knew enough to attack the\n",
      "padlocks on his leg chains, and break them if possible. No ordinary clevis would\n",
      "hold him. When the pin was threaded at one end and screwed into its place, Gunda\n",
      "would work at it, hour by hour, until he would start it to unscrewing, and then\n",
      "his trunk-tip would do the rest. The only clevis that he could not open was one\n",
      "in which a stout cotter pin was passed through the end of the clevis-pin and\n",
      "strongly bent. Through reasons emanating in his own savage brain, Gunda took\n",
      "strong dislikes to several of our park people. He hated Dick Richards,âthe\n",
      "keeper of Alice. He hated a certain mes- senger boy, a certain laborer, a\n",
      "painter and Mr. Ditmars. Toward me he was tolerant, and never rushed at me to\n",
      "kill me, as he always did to his pet aversions. He stood in open fear of his own\n",
      "keeper, Walter Thuman, until he had studied out a plan to catch him off his\n",
      "guard and âget him.â Then he launched his long-contemplated attack, and\n",
      "Thuman was almost killed. Our present (1921) male African elephant, Kartoum, is\n",
      "not so hostile toward people, but his insatiable desire is to break and to smash\n",
      "all of his environment that can be bent or broken. His ingenuity in finding ways\n",
      "to damage doors and gates, and to bend or to break steel beams, is amazing. His\n",
      "greatest feat con- sisted in breaking squarely in two, by pushing with his head,\n",
      "a 90-pQund steel railroad iron used as the top bar of his fence. He knows the\n",
      "mechanism of the latch of the ponderous steel door between his two box stalls,\n",
      "and nothing but a small pin that only human fingers can manipulate suffices to\n",
      "thwart his efforts to control the latch. Kartoum has gone over every inch of\n",
      "surface of his two apartments, his doors, gates and fences, to find something\n",
      "that he can break or damage. The steel linings of his apartment walls,\n",
      "originally five feet high, we have been compelled to extend upward to a height\n",
      "of nine feet, to save the brick walls from being battered and disfigured. He has\n",
      "searched his steel fences throughout, in order to find their weakest points, and\n",
      "concentrate his attacks upon them. If the sharp-pointed iron spikes three inches\n",
      "long that are set all over his doors are per- fectly solid, he respects them,\n",
      "but if one is the least bit loose in its socket, he works at it until he finally\n",
      "breaks it off. I invite any Doubting Thomas who thinks that Kartoum does not\n",
      "âthinkâ and âreasonâ to try his own thinking and reasoning at inventing\n",
      "for Kartoumâs door a latch that a keeper can easily and surely open and close\n",
      "at a distance of ten feet, and that will be Kartoum-proof. As for ourselves,\n",
      "three or four seemingly intelligent officers and keepers, and a capable foreman\n",
      "of construction, have all they can do to keep ahead of that one elephant, so\n",
      "great is his ingenuity in thwarting our ways and means to restrain him. In about\n",
      "two days of effort our elephant keepers taught Gunda to receive a coin from the\n",
      "hand of a visitor, or pick it off the floor, lift the lid of a high-placed\n",
      "cash-box, drop the coin into it and ring a bell. This very amusing industry was\n",
      "kept up for several years, but finally it became so popular that it had to be\n",
      "discontinued. Keeper Dick Richards easily taught Alice to blow a mouth organ,\n",

      "convincingly creditable to the elephant. As a test of memory in an animal, we\n",

      "years millions of people have witnessed in either Barnumâs or Ringling\n",
      "Brothersâ shows, or in the two combined, an imita- tion military drill\n",
      "performed by from twelve to twenty elephants which in animals of any other\n",
      "species would be considered a remarkable performance. The following were the\n",
      "commands given by one trainer, understood and remembered by each ele- phant, and\n",
      "executed without any visible hesitation or mistake. These we will call the\n",
      "Accomplishments of Performing Elephants. 1. Fall in line. 2. Roll-call. (As each\n",
      "elephantâs name is called, he takes his place in the ranks). 3. Present arms.\n",
      "(The trunk is uplifted, with its tip curved forward and held in that position\n",
      "for a short time.) 4. Forward, march. 5. File left, march. 6. Right about face,\n",

      "Going lame in a hind leg. 20. Stepping up on a tub turned bottom up. blankets,\n",
      "and lying down. (From A. G. R. Theobald, Mysore) 21. Standing on a tub on right\n",
      "legs only. 22. The same, on opposite legs. 23. The same, on the fore legs only.\n",
      "24. The same, on the hind legs only. 25. Using a fan. 26. Turning a hand-organ.\n",
      "27. Using a handkerchief to wipe the eyes. 28. Sitting in a chair. 29. Kneeling,\n",
      "with the fore legs. 30. Kneeling with the hind legs. 31. Walking astride a man\n",
      "lying lengthwise. 32. Stepping over a man lying down. 33. Forming a pyramid of\n",
      "elephants, by using tubs of various sizes. While it is true that not all of the\n",
      "acts in the latter part of this performance were performed by each one of the\n",
      "elephants who went through the military drill, there is no reason to doubt the\n",
      "entire ability of each individual to be trained to obey the whole thirty-three\n",
      "commands, and to remember them all accurately and without confusion. The most\n",
      "astonishing feature of the performance, aside from the perfect obedience of the\n",
      "huge beasts, was their easy confidence and accuracy of memory. We come now to a\n",
      "consideration of the Accomplishments of Working Elephants. In all the\n",
      "timber-forests of southern India every captive elephant is taught to perform all\n",
      "the following acts and services, as I have witnessed on many occasions: 1. To\n",
      "salaam, or salute, by raising the trunk. 2. To kneel, to receive a load or a\n",
      "passenger. 3. When standing, to hold up a fore-foot, to serve the driver as a\n",
      "step in climbing to his place. 4. To lie down to be washed, first on one side\n",
      "and then on the other. 6. To âhand upâ any article from the ground to the\n",
      "reach of a person riding. 7. To pull down an obstructing bough. 8. To halt. 9.\n",
      "To back. 10. To pick up the end of a drag-rope and place it between the teeth.\n",
      "11. To drag a timber. 12. To kneel and with the head turn a log over, or turn it\n",
      "with the tusks if any are present. 13. To push a log into position parallel with\n",
      "others. 14. To balance and carry timbers on the tusks, if possessing tusks of\n",
      "sufficient size. 15. To âspeak,â or trumpet. 16. To work in harness. Every\n",
      "working elephant in India is supposed to possess the intelligence necessary to\n",
      "the performance of all the acts enum- erated above at the command of his driver,\n",
      "either by spoken words, a pressure of the knees or feet, or a touch with the\n",
      "driving goad. For the sake of generalization I have purposely excluded from this\n",
      "list all tricks and accomplishments which are not universally taught to working\n",
      "elephants. We have seen, how- ever, that performing elephants are capable of\n",
      "executing nearly double the number of acts commonly taught to the workers; and,\n",
      "while it is useless to speculate upon the subject, it must be admitted that,\n",
      "were a trainer to test an elephantâs memory by ascertaining the exact number\n",
      "of commands it could remember and execute in rotation, the result would far\n",
      "exceed anything yet obtained. For my own part, I believe it would exceed a\n",
      "hundred. The performance in the circus-ring is limited by time and space, and\n",
      "not by the mental capacity of the elephants. Comprehension under Training. When\n",
      "we come to consider the comparative mental receptivity and comprehension of\n",
      "animals under manâs tuition, we find the elephant absolutely unsurpassed. ii 3\n",
      "On account of the fact that an elephant is about eighteen years in coming to\n",
      "anything like maturity, according to the Indian Government standard for working\n",
      "animals, it is far more economical and expeditious to catch full-grown elephants\n",
      "in their native jungles, and train them, than it is to breed and rear them.\n",
      "About ninety per cent of all the elephants now living in captivity were caught\n",
      "in a wild state and tamed, and of the remainder at least eighty per cent were\n",
      "born in captivity of females that were gravid when captured. It will be seen,\n",
      "therefore, that the elephant has derived no advantage whatever from ancestral\n",
      "association with man, and has gained nothing from the careful selection and\n",
      "breeding which, all combined, have made the collie dog, the pointer and the\n",
      "setter the won- derfully intelligent animals they are. For many generations the\n",
      "horse has been bred for strength, for speed, or for beauty of form, but the\n",
      "breeding of the dog has been based chiefly on his intelligence as a means to an\n",
      "end. With all his advantages, it is to be doubted whether the comprehensive\n",
      "faculties of the dog, even in the most exceptional individuals of a whole race,\n",
      "are equal to those of the adult wild elephant fresh from the jungle. The extreme\n",
      "difficulty of teaching a dog of mature age even the simplest thing is so well\n",
      "known that it has passed into a proverb: âIt is hard to teach an old dog new\n",
      "tricks.â In other words, the conditions must be favorable. But what is the\n",
      "case with the elephant? The question shall be answered by G. P. Sanderson. In\n",
      "his âWild Beasts of India,â he says: uNor are there any elephants which can\n",
      "not be easily subjugated, whatever their size or age. The largest and oldest\n",
      "elephants are frequently the most easily tamedj as they are less apprehensive\n",
      "than the younger ones.â Philosophy of the Elephant in Accepting Captivity and\n",
      "Making the Best of It. The most astounding feature in the education of an\n",
      "elephant is the suddenness of his transi- tion from a wild and lawless denizen\n",
      "of the forest to the quiet, plodding, good-tempered, and cheerful beast of\n",
      "draught or burden. I call it astounding, because in comparison with what could\n",
      "not be done with other wild animals caught when adult, no other word is adequate\n",
      "to express the difference. The average wild animal caught fully grown is âa\n",
      "terror,â and so far as training is concerned, perfectly impossible. There\n",
      "takes place in the keddah, or pen of capture, a mighty struggle between the\n",
      "giant strength of the captive and the in- genuity of man, ably seconded by a few\n",
      "powerful tame ele- phants. When he finds his strength utterly overcome by\n",
      "manâs intelligence, he yields to the inevitable, and accepts the situation\n",
      "philosophically. Sanderson once had a narrow escape from death while on the back\n",
      "of a tame elephant inside a keddah, attempting to secure a wild female. She\n",
      "fought his elephant long and viciously, with the strength and courage of\n",
      "despair, but finally she was overcome by superior numbers. Although her attack\n",
      "on Sanderson in the keddah was of the most mur- derous description, he states\n",
      "that her conduct after her defeat was most exemplary, and she never afterward\n",
      "showed any signs of ill-temper. Mr. Sanderson and an elephant-driver once\n",
      "mounted a full-grown female elephant on the sixth day after her capture, without\n",
      "even the presence of a tame animal. Sir Emerson Ten- nent records an instance\n",
      "wherein an elephant fed from the hand on the first night of its capture, and in\n",
      "a very few days evinced pleasure at being patted on the head. Such instances as\n",
      "the above can be multiplied indefinitely. To what else shall they be attributed\n",
      "than philosophic reasoning on the part of the elephant? The orang-utan and the\n",
      "chimpanzee, so often put forward as his intellectual superior, when captured\n",
      "alive at any other period than that of helpless infancy, are vicious, ag-\n",
      "gressive, and intractable not only for weeks and months, but for the remainder\n",
      "of their lives. Orangs captured when fully adult exhibit the most tiger-like\n",
      "ferocity, and are wholly intractable. If dogs are naturally superior to\n",
      "elephants in natural intel- lect, it should be as easy to tame and educate\n",
      "newly-caught wild dogs or wolves of mature age, as newly-caught elephants. But,\n",
      "so far from this being the case, it is safe to assert that it would be\n",
      "impossible to train even the most intelligent company of pointers, setters or\n",
      "collies ever got together to perform the feats accomplished with such promptness\n",
      "and accuracy by all regularly trained work elephants. The successful training of\n",
      "all elephants up to the required working point is so fully conceded in India\n",
      "that the market value of an animal depends wholly upon its age, sex, build and\n",
      "the presence or absence of good tusks. The animal's education is either\n",
      "sufficient for the buyer, or, if it is not, he knows it can be made so.\n",
      "Promptness and Accuracy in the Execution of. Manâs Orders. This is the fourth\n",
      "quality which serves as a key to the mental capacity and mental processes of an\n",
      "animal. To me the most impressive feature of a performance of elephants in the\n",
      "circus-ring is the fact that every command uttered is obeyed with true military\n",
      "promptness and freedom from hesitation, and so accurately that an entire\n",
      "performance often is conducted and concluded without the repetition of a single\n",
      "command. One by one the orders are executed with the most human-like precision\n",
      "and steadiness, amounting sometimes to actual nonchalance. Human beings of the\n",
      "highest type scarcely could do better. To some savage racesâfor example, the\n",
      "native Australians, the Veddahs of Ceylon, or thejackoons of the Malay\n",
      "Peninsula, I believe that such a performance would be impossible, even under\n",
      "training. I do not believe their minds act with sufficient rapidity and accuracy\n",
      "to enable a company of them to go through with such a wholly arti- ficial\n",
      "performance as successfully as the elephants do. The thoughtful observer does\n",
      "not need to be told that the brain of the ponderous quadruped acts, as far as it\n",
      "goes, with the same rapidity and precision as that of an intelligent man,â and\n",
      "this, too, in a performance that is wholly artificial and ac- quired. In the\n",
      "performance of Bartholomewâs horses, of which I once kept a record in detail,\n",
      "even the most accomplished members of his troupe often had to be commanded again\n",
      "and again before they would obey. A command often was repeated for the fifth or\n",
      "sixth time before the desired result was obtained. I noted particularly that not\n",
      "one of his horses,âwhich were the most perfectly trained of any ever seen by\n",
      "me,âwas an excep- tion to this rule, or performed his tasks with the prompt\n",
      "obedi- ence and self-confidence so noticeable in each one of the sixteen Barnum\n",
      "elephants. The horses usually obeyed with tardiness and hesitation, and very\n",
      "often manifested neivousness and uncertainty. In the mind of the elephant, e.\n",
      "g., each elephant, there was no confusion of ideas or lapses of memory, but, on\n",
      "the con- trary, the mental grasp on the whole subject was so secure and\n",
      "comprehensive that the animal felt himself the master of the situation. I have\n",
      "never yet seen a performance of trained dogs which could be considered worthy of\n",
      "serious comparison with the ac- complishments of either performing or working\n",
      "elephants. In the matter of native educational capacity the dog can not on any\n",
      "grounds be considered the rival of the elephant. The alleged mental superiority\n",
      "of the dog is based almost wholly upon his powers of independent reasoning and\n",
      "observation as exhibited in a state of almost perfect freedom. Until the ele-\n",
      "phant who has grown to maturity under manâs influence, is allowed the dogâs\n",
      "freedom to plan and execute, no conclusive comparison between them can be made.\n",
      "Moral Qualities of the Elephant. Finally, we come to a consideration of the\n",
      "elephantâs moral qualities that have a direct bearing upon our subject. In\n",
      "India, excepting the pro- fessional â rogue,â the elephant bears a spotless\n",
      "reputation for patience, amiability and obedience. The ârogueâ is an indi-\n",
      "vidual afflicted with either an incorrigible disposition, or else is afflicted\n",
      "with insanity, either temporary or permanent. I know of no instance on record\n",
      "wherein a normal elephant with a healthy mind has been guilty of unprovoked\n",
      "homicide, or even of attempting it. I have never heard of an elephant in India\n",
      "so much as kicking, striking or otherwise injuring either human beings or other\n",
      "domestic animals. There have been several instances, however, of persons killed\n",
      "by elephants which were temporarily insane, or âmustâ and also by others\n",
      "permanently insane. In America several persons have been killed in re- venge for\n",
      "ill treatment. In Brooklyn a female elephant once killed a civilian who burned\n",
      "her trunk with a lighted cigar. It is the misfortune but not the fault of the\n",
      "elephant that in advanced age or by want of necessary exercise, he is liable to\n",
      "be attacked by must, or sexual insanity, during which period he is clearly\n",
      "irresponsible for his acts. So many men have been killed by elephants in this\n",
      "country that of late years the idea has been steadily gaining ground that\n",
      "elephants are naturally ill-tempered, and vicious to a dan- gerous extent. Under\n",
      "fair conditions, nothing could be farther from the truth. We have seen that in\n",
      "the hands of the âgentle Hinduâ the elephant is safe and reliable, and never\n",
      "attacks man except under the circumstances already stated. In this country,\n",
      "however, many an elephant is at the mercy of quick- tempered and sometimes\n",
      "revengeful showmen, who very often do not understand the temperaments of the\n",
      "animals under their control, and who during the traveling season are rendered\n",
      "perpetually ill-tempered and vindictive by reason of overwork and insufficient\n",
      "sleep. With such masters as these it is no wonder that occasionally an animal\n",
      "rebels, and executes ven- geance. In Minneapolis in December an elephant once\n",
      "went on a rampage through the freezing of its ears. I am quite con- vinced that\n",
      "an elephant could by illtreatment be driven to insanity, and I have no doubt\n",
      "that this has been done many times. Our bad elephant, Gunda, was bad by nature,\n",
      "but finally he became afflicted with sexual insanity, for which there was no\n",
      "cure. When commanded by man, the elephant will tear a criminal limb from limb,\n",
      "or crush him to death with his knees, or go out to battle holding a sword in his\n",
      "trunk. He will, when told to do so, attack his kind with fury and persistence;\n",
      "but in the course of many hours, and even days, spent in watching wild herds, I\n",
      "never yet saw a single individual show any signs of impatience or ill-temper\n",
      "toward his fellows. It is safe to say that, thus far, not one half the\n",
      "elephantâs mental capabilities have been developed, or even understood. It\n",
      "would be of great interest to determine by experiment the full educational\n",
      "capacity of this interesting quadruped. It would be equally interesting to\n",
      "determine the limit of its reason- ing powers in applied mechanics. An animal\n",
      "that can turn a hand-organ at the proper speed, or ring a telephone and go\n",
      "through the motions of listening with a receiver, can be taught to push a\n",
      "smoothing-plane invented purposely for him; but whether he would learn of\n",
      "himself to plane the rough surface smooth, and let the smooth ones remain\n",
      "untouched, is an open question. While it is generally fruitless and\n",
      "unsatisfactory to enter the field of speculation, I can not resist the\n",
      "temptation to assert my belief that an elephant can be taught to read written\n",
      "char- acters, and also to express some of his own thoughts or states of feeling\n",
      "in writing. It would be a perfectly simple matter to prepare suitable appliances\n",
      "by which the sagacious animal could hold a crayon in his trunk, and mark upon a\n",
      "surface adapted to his convenience. Many an elephant has been taught to make\n",
      "vhalk-marks on a blackboard. In Ilianâs work on âThe Nature of Animals,â\n",
      "the eleventh chapter of the second book, he describes in detail the wonderful\n",
      "performances of elephants at Rome, all of which he saw. One passage is of\n",
      "peculiar interest to us, and the following has been given as a translation: â\n",
      ". . .1 saw them writing letters on Roman tablets with their trunks, neither\n",
      "looking awry nor turning aside. The hand, however, of the teacher was placed so\n",
      "as to be a guide in the formation of the letters; and, while it was writing, the\n",
      "animal kept its eye fixed down in an accomplished and scholar-like manner.â I\n",
      "can conceive how an elephant may be taught that certain characters represent\n",
      "certain ideas, and that they are capable of intelligent combinations. The system\n",
      "and judgment and patient effort which developed an active, educated, and even\n",
      "refined intellect in Laura Bridgmanâdeaf, dumb and blind from birthâought\n",
      "certainly to be able to teach a clear-headed, intelligent elephant to express at\n",
      "least some of his thoughts in writing. I believe it is as much an act of murder\n",
      "to wantonly take the life of a healthy elephant as to kill a native Australian\n",
      "or a Central-African savage. If it is more culpable to kill an ignorant human\n",
      "savage than an elephant, it is also more culpa- ble to kill an elephant than an\n",
      "echinoderm. Many men are both morally and intellectually lower than many\n",
      "quadrupeds, and are, in my opinion, as wholly destitute of that indefinable\n",
      "attribute called soul as all the lower animals commonly are supposed to be. If\n",
      "an investigator like Dr. Yerkes, and an educator like Dr. Howe, should take it\n",
      "in hand to develop the mind of the ele- phant to the highest possible extent,\n",
      "their results would be awaited with peculiar interest, and it would be strange\n",
      "if they did not necessitate a revision of the theories now common among those\n",
      "who concede an immortal soul to every member of the human race, even down to the\n",
      "lowest, but deny it to all the animals below man. Curvature in the Brain of an\n",
      "Elephant. There is curvature of the spine; and there is curvature in the brain.\n",
      "It afflicts the human race, and all other vertebrates are subject to it. In the\n",
      "Zoological Park we have had, and still have, a per- sistent case of it in a\n",
      "female Indian elephant now twenty-three years of age, named âAlice.â Her\n",
      "mental ailment several times manifested itself in Luna Park, her former home;\n",
      "but when we purchased the animal her former owners carelessly forgot to mention\n",
      "it. Four days after Alice reached her new temporary home in our Antelope House,\n",
      "and while being marched around the Park for exercise, she heard the strident cry\n",
      "of one of our mountain lions, and immediately turned and bolted. Young as she\n",
      "was at that time, her two strong and able- bodied keepers, Thuman and\n",
      "Bayreuther, were utterly unable to restrain her. She surged straight forward for\n",
      "the front door of the Reptile House, and into that building she went, with the\n",
      "two keepers literally swinging from her ears. As the great beast suddenly loomed\n",
      "up above the crowd of sightseers in the quiet building, the crowd screamed and\n",
      "became almost panic-stricken. Partly by her own volition and partly by\n",
      "encouragement, she circumnavigated the turtle-bank and went out. Once outside\n",
      "she went where she pleased, and the keepers were quite unable to control her.\n",
      "Half an hour later she again headed for the Reptile House and we knew that she\n",
      "would again try to enter. In view of the great array of plate glass cases in\n",
      "that build- ing, many of them containing venomous cobras, rattlesnakes,\n",
      "moccasins and bushmasters, we were thoroughly frightened at the prospect of that\n",
      "crazy beast again coming within reach of them. With our men fighting\n",
      "frantically, and exhausted by their prolonged efforts to control her, Alice\n",
      "again entered the Reptile House. As she attempted to pass into the main\n",
      "hall,âthe danger zone,âour men succeeded in chaining her front feet to the\n",
      "two steel posts of the guard rail, set solidly in concrete on each side of the\n",

      "region. One day a lady and gentleman called to see the pet, to observe how tame\n",
      "and good-natured it was. The owner took on his arm a basket of tempting apples,\n",
      "and going into the bearâs territory proceeded to show how the Black One would\n",

      "from the bearâs claw-shod paws rained upon Mr. C.âs head, and his scalp was\n",
      "almost torn away. In the melee he fell, and the bear pounced upon him, to kill\n",
      "him. The visiting gentleman rushed for a club. Meanwhile the lady visitor,\n",
      "rendered frantic by the sight of the bear killing her host, did a very brave but\n",

      "Next to the apes and monkeys, I regard bears as the most demonstrative of all\n",
      "wild animals. The average bear is proficient in the art of expression. The\n",
      "position of his ears, the pose of his head and neck, the mobility of his lips\n",
      "and his walking or his resting attitudes all tell their story. To facial and\n",
      "bodily expression the bear adds his voice; and herein he surpasses most other\n",
      "wild animals! According to his mood he whines, he threatens, or warns by loud\n",
      "snorting. He roars with rage, and when in pain he cries, or he bawls and howls.\n",
      "In addition to this he threatens an enemy by snapping his jaws together with a\n",
      "mighty ominous clank, accompanied by a warning nasal whine. An angry bear will\n",
      "at times give a sudden rake with his claws to the ground, or the concrete on\n",

      "philosophic minds, and excellent reasoning power, though rarely equal to that of\n",
      "the elephant. One striking proof of this is the promptness with which adult\n",
      "animals accept comfortable captivity, and settle down in con- tentment. What we\n",
      "mean by comfortable captivity very shortly will be defined. No bear should be\n",
      "kept in a cage with stone walls and an uneven floor; nor without a place to\n",
      "climb; and wherein life is a daily chapter of inactive and lonesome discomfort\n",
      "and un- happiness. The old-fashioned bear âpitâ is an abomination of\n",
      "desolation, a sink-hole of misery, and all such means of bear torture should be\n",
      "banished from all civilized countries. He who cannot make bears comfortable,\n",

      "what the blacks have very wisely not done. They have broken the truce of\n",

      "staged by Col. C. J. (âBuf- faloââ) Jones when he was superintendent of\n",

      "bears. Case 1. The Steel Panel. Two huge male Alaskan brown bears, Ivan and\n",
      "Admiral, lived in adjoining yards. The parti- tion between them consisted of\n",
      "panels of steel. The upper panels were of heavy bar iron. The bottom panels,\n",
      "each four feet high and six feet long, were of flat steel bars woven into a\n",
      "basket pattern. The ends of these flat bars had been passed through narrow slots\n",
      "in the heavy steel frame, and firmly clinched. We would have said that no land\n",
      "animal smaller than an elephant could pull out one of those panels. By some\n",
      "strange aberration in management, one day it chanced that Admiralâs grizzly\n",
      "bear wife was introduced fora brief space into Ivanâs den. Immediately Admiral\n",
      "went into a rage, on the ground that his constitutional rights had been\n",
      "infringed. At once he set to work to recover his stolen com- panion. He began to\n",
      "test those partition panels, one by one. Finally he found the one that seemed to\n",
      "him least powerful, and he at once set to work to tear it out of its frame. The\n",
      "keepers knew that he could not succeed; but he thought differently. Hooking his\n",
      "short but very powerful claws into the meshes he braced backward and pulled.\n",
      "After a fierce struggle an upper corner yielded. Then the other corner yielded;\n",
      "and at last the whole upper line gave way. I reached the scene just as he\n",
      "finished tearing both ends free. I saw him bend the steel panel inward, crush it\n",
      "down with his thousand pounds of weight, and dash through the yawning hole into\n",
      "his rivalâs arena. Then ensued a great battle. The two huge bears rose high on\n",
      "their hind legs, fiercely struck out with their front paws, and fought mouth to\n",
      "mouth, always aiming to grip the throat. They bit each otherâs cheeks but no\n",
      "serious injuries were in- flicted, and very soon by the vigorous use of\n",

      "Mystery of Death. Once upon a time we had a Japanese black bear named Jappie,\n",
      "quartered in a den with a Himalayan black bear,â-the species with long, black\n",
      "side-whiskers and a white tip to its chin. The Japanese bear was about one-third\n",
      "smaller than the Himalayan black. One night the Japanese bear died, and in the\n",

      "dens. At once they went in to remove the body; but the Himalayan black bear\n",
      "angrily refused to permit them to touch it. For half an hour the men made one\n",

      "the dead body, but in vain. When I reached the strange and uncanny scene, the\n",
      "guardian bear was in a great rage. It took a position across the limp body, and\n",
      "from that it fiercely refused to move or to be driven. As an experiment we threw\n",
      "in a lot of leaves, and the guardian promptly raked them over the dead one and\n",

      "Tommy made a feeble attempt at defense, but Bob seized him by the back, bit him,\n",
      "and savagely shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. The Terror yelled lustily\n",
      "âMurder! Murder! Help!â but none of the other bears made a move for his\n",

      "Rockies of British Columbia, in the month of Septem- ber (1905), while bears\n",
      "were very active. Mr. John M. Phillips and I shot two large white goats, one of\n",
      "which rolled down a steep declivity and out upon the slide- rock, where it was\n",
      "skinned. The flensed body of the other was rolled over the edge of a cliff, and\n",
      "fell on a brushy soil-covered spot about on the same level as the remains of\n",
      "goat No. 1. The fresh goat remains were promptly discovered by a lusty young\n",
      "grizzly, which ate to satiety from Goat No. 1. With the remains of Goat No. 2\n",
      "the grizzly industriously proceeded to establish a cache of meat for future use.\n",
      "The goat carcass was dragged to a well chosen spot of se- clusion on\n",
      "moss-covered earth. On the steep hillside a shallow hole was dug, the whole\n",
      "carcass rolled into it, and then upon it the bear piled nearly a wagon load of\n",
      "fresh earth, moss, and green plants that had been torn up by the roots. Over the\n",
      "highest point of the carcass the mass wastwenty-fourinchesdeep. On the ground\n",
      "the cache was elliptical in shape, and its outline measured about seven by nine\n",
      "feet. On the lower side it was four feet high, and on the upper side two feet.\n",
      "The cache was built around two larch saplings, as if to secure their support. On\n",
      "the uphill side of the cache the ground was torn up in a space shaped like a\n",
      "half moon, twenty-eight feet long by nineteen wide. I regard that cache as a\n",
      "very impressive exhibit of ursine thought, reasoning and conclusion. It showed\n",
      "more fore- thought and provision, and higher purpose in the conservation of food\n",
      "than some human beings ever display, even at their best. The plains Indians and\n",
      "the buffalo hunters were horribly waste- ful and improvident. The impulse of\n",

      "animal without learning something of its thoughts and its temper. In our\n",
      "Zoological Park, day by day and hour by hour our people carry into practical\n",
      "effect their knowledge of the psy- chology of our mammals, birds and reptiles.\n",
      "In view of the work that we have done during the past twenty-one years of the\n",
      "Parkâs history, we do not need to apologize for claiming to know certain\n",
      "definite things about wild animal minds. It is my belief that nowhere in the\n",
      "world is there in one place so large an aggregation of dangerous beasts, birds\n",
      "and reptiles as ours. And yet accidents to our keepers from them have been\n",
      "exceedingly few, and all have been slight save four. Twenty-five years ago I\n",
      "endeavored to plan for the Zoo- logical Society the most humane and satisfactory\n",
      "bear dens on earth. Fortunately we knew something about bears, both wild and\n",
      "captive. Never before have we written out the exact motif of those dens, but it\n",
      "is easily told. We endeavored to give each bear the following things: A very\n",
      "large and luxurious den, open to the sky, and practically on a level with the\n",
      "world; Perfect sanitation; A great level playground of smooth concrete; High,\n",
      "sloping rocks to climb upon when tired of the level floor; A swimming pool,\n",
      "always full and always clean; Openwork steel partitions between cages, to\n",
      "promote sociability and cheerfulness; Plenty of sunlight, but an adequate amount\n",
      "of shade; Dry and dark sleeping dens with wooden floors, and Close-up views of\n",
      "all bears for all visitors. If there are anywhere in the wilds any bears as\n",
      "healthy, happy and as secure in their life tenure as ours, I do not know of\n",
      "them. The wild bear lives in hourly fear of being shot, and of going to bed\n",
      "hungry. The service of our bear dens is based upon our knowledge of bear\n",
      "pyschology. We knew in the beginning that about 97 per cent of our bears would\n",
      "come to us as cubs, or at least when quite young, and we decided to take full\n",
      "advantage of that fact. All our bears save hah a dozen all told, have been\n",
      "trained to permit the keepers of the dens to go into their cages, and to make no\n",
      "fuss about it. The bears know that when the keepers enter to do the morning\n",
      "housework, or at any other time for any other purpose, they must at once climb\n",
      "up to the gallery, above the sleeping dens, and stay there until the keepers\n",
      "retire. A bear who is slow about going up is sternly ordered to âGo on!â and\n",
      "if he shows any inclination to disobey, a heavy hickory pick-handle is thrown at\n",
      "him with no uncertain hand. Now, in grooming a herd of bears, a hickory\n",
      "pick-handle leaves no room for argument. If it hits, it hurts. If it does not\n",
      "hit a bear, it strikes the concrete floor or the rocks with a resound and a\n",
      "rebound that frightens the boldest bear almost as much as being hit. So the bear\n",
      "herd wisely climbs up to the first balcony and sits down to wait. No bear ever\n",
      "leaps down to attack a keeper. The distance and the jolt are not pleasant; and\n",
      "whenever a bear grows weary and essays to climb down, he is sternly ordered\n",
      "back. The keepers are forbidden to permit any familiarities on the part of their\n",
      "bears. All the bears, save one, that have come to us fully grown, and savage,\n",
      "have been managed by other methods, involving shifting cages. On two occasions\n",
      "only have any of our keepers been badly bitten in our bear dens. Both attacks\n",
      "were due to over- trustfulness of âpetted7â bears, and to direct\n",
      "disobedience of fixed orders. From the very beginning I laid down this law for\n",
      "our keepers, and have repeated it from year to year. â Make no pets of animals\n",
      "large enough to become dangerous. Make every animal understand and admit day by\n",

      "animal usually breeds contempt and attack. Timidity is so fatal that none but\n",

      "case of real heroism in our bear dens, which went in with âthe dayâs\n",
      "work,â as many others have done. Keeper Fred Schlosser thought it would be\n",
      "safe to take our official photographer, Mr. E. R. Sanborn, into the den of a\n",
      "European brown bear mother, to get a close-up photograph of her and her cubs.\n",
      "Schlosser felt sure that Brownie was âall right,â and that he could prevent\n",
      "any accident. But near the end of the work the mother bear drove her cubs into\n",
      "their sleeping den and then made a sudden, vicious and most unexpected attack\n",
      "upon Keeper Schlosser. She rushed him, knocked him down, seized him by his\n",
      "thigh, bit him severely, and then actually began to drag him to the door of her\n",
      "sleeping den! (Just why she did this I cannot explain!) Heroically ignoring the\n",
      "great risk to himself, and thinking of nothing but saving Schlosser, Mr. Sanborn\n",
      "seized the club that had fallen from the keeperâs hand when he fell, rushed up\n",
      "to the enraged bear and beat her over the head so savagely and so skilfully that\n",
      "she was glad to let go of her victim and retreat into her den. Then Mr. Sanborn\n",
      "seized Schlosser, dragged him away from the den, and stood guard over him until\n",
      "help came. xm MENTAL TRAITS OF A FEW RUMINANTS WHEN we wish to cover with a\n",
      "single word the hoofed and horned âbig gameâ of the world, we say Ruminants.\n",
      "That easy and comprehensive name embraces (i) the Bison and Wild Cattle, (2) the\n",
      "Sheep, Goats, Ibexes and Markhors, (3) the Deer Family and (4) the Antelope\n",
      "Family. These groups must be considered separately, because the variations in\n",
      "mind and temperament are quite well marked; but beyond wisdom in\n",
      "self-preservation, I do not regard the intelligence of wild ruminants as being\n",
      "really great. Intellectually the ruminants are not as high as the apes and\n",
      "monkeys, bears, wolves, foxes and dogs, the domestic horses and the elephants.\n",
      "They are handicapped by feet that are good for locomotion and defense, but\n",
      "otherwise are almost as helpless as so many jointed sticks. This condition\n",
      "closes to the ruminants the possibility of a long program of activities which\n",
      "the ruminant brain might otherwise develop. The ruminant hoof and leg is well\n",
      "designed for swift and rough travel, for battles with distance, snow, ice, mud\n",
      "and flood, and for a certain amount of fighting, but they are inept for the\n",
      "higher manifestations of brain power. Because of this unfortunate condition, the\n",
      "study of rumi- nants in captivity does not yield a great crop of results. The\n",
      "free wild animals are far better subjects, and it is from them that we have\n",
      "derived our best knowledge of ruminant thoughts and ways. It is not possible,\n",
      "however, to set forth here any more than a limited number of representative\n",
      "species. THE BISON AND WILD CATTLE. The American Bison.âThrough the age-long\n",
      "habit of the American bison H 3 to live in large herds, and to feel, generation\n",
      "after generation, the sense of personal security that great numbers usually\n",
      "impart, the bison early acquired the reputation of being a stolid or even a\n",
      "stupid animal. Particularly was this the case in the days of the greatest bison\n",
      "destruction, when a still- hunter could get âa standâ on a bunch of\n",
      "buffaloes quietly grazing at the edge of the great mass, and slowly and surely\n",
      "shoot down each animal that attempted to lead that group away from the sound of\n",
      "his rifle. During that fatal period the state of the buffalo mind was nothing\n",
      "less than a tragedy. âThe bunchâ would hear a report two hundred yards away,\n",
      "they would see a grazing cow suddenly and mysteriously fall, struggle, kick the\n",
      "air, and pre- sently lie still. The individuals nearest dully wondered what it\n",
      "was all about. Those farthest away looked once only, and went on grazing. If an\n",
      "experienced old cow grew suspicious and wary, and quietly set out to walk away\n",
      "from those mysterious noises, âbang!â said the Mystery once more, and she\n",
      "would be the one to fall. On this murderous plan, a lucky and experienced hunter\n",
      "could kill from twenty to sixty head of buffaloes, mostly cows, on a space of\n",
      "three or four acres. The fatal trouble was that each buffalo felt that the\n",
      "presence of a hundred or a thousand others feeding close by was an in- surance\n",
      "of security to the individual, and so there was no stampede. But after all, the\n",
      "bison is not so big a fool as he looks. He can think; and he can learn. In 1886,\n",

      "but otherwise sound? Did he go limping about over the landscape, to attract\n",
      "enemies from afar, and be quickly shot by a man or torn to pieces by wolves? Not\n",
      "he! With the keen intelligence of the wounded wild ruminant, he chose the line\n",
      "of least resistance, and on three legs fled downhill. He went on down, and kept\n",
      "going, until he reached the bottom of the biggest and most tortuous coulee in\n",
      "his neighborhood. And then what? Instead of coming to rest in a reposeful little\n",
      "valley a hundred feet wide, he chose the most rugged branch he could find, the\n",
      "one with the steepest and highest banks, and up that dry bed, with many a twist\n",
      "and turn, he painfully limped his way. At last he found himself in a snug and\n",
      "safe ditch, precisely like a front line trench seven feet wide, with\n",
      "perpendicular walls and zig-zagging so persistently that the deâil himself\n",
      "could not find him save by following him up to close quarters, and landing upon\n",
      "his horns. There, without food or water, the wounded animal would stand for many\n",
      "days,âin fact, until hunger would force him back to the valleyâs crop of\n",
      "grass. His wild remedy was to keep still, and give that broken leg its chance to\n",
      "knit and grow strong. I have seen in buffalo skeletons healed bone fractures\n",
      "that filled us with wonder. One case that we shot was a big and heavy bull whose\n",
      "hip socket had been utterly smashed, femur head and all, by a heavy rifle ball;\n",
      "but the bull had escaped in spite of his wound, and he had nursed it until it\n",
      "had healed in good working order. We can testify that he could run as well as\n",
      "any of the bisons in his bunch. Of course young bisons can be tamed, and to a\n",
      "certain extent educated. âBuffaloâ Jones broke a pair of two-year- old bulls\n",

      "bits, but the buffaloes refused to work with them. With tight-fitting halters,\n",
      "and the exercise of much muscle, he was able for a time to make them âgeeâ\n",
      "and âhaw.â But not for long. When they outgrew his ability in free-hand\n",
      "drawing, he rigged an upright windlass on each side of his wagon-box, and firmly\n",
      "attached a line to each. When the team was desired to âgee,â he deftly wound\n",
      "up the right line on its windlass, and vice versa for âhaw.â But even this\n",
      "did not last a great while. The motor control was more tentative than absolute.\n",
      "Once while driving beside a creek on a hot and thirsty day, the super-heated\n",
      "buffaloes suddenly espied the water, twenty feet or so below the road. Without\n",
      "having been bidden they turned toward it, and the windlass failed to stop them.\n",

      "blent.â Although they secured their drink, their reputation as draught oxen\n",

      "that they must rush widly to and fro before it occurs. But there are exceptions.\n",

      "twenty-seven years of protection, feeding in herds in the main street of Ouray,\n",
      "Colorado, is an object lesson never to be forgotten by any student of wild\n",

      "that those animals have not thought to some purpose upon the important question\n",
      "of danger and safety to sheep? Is there anyone left who still believes the\n",

      "down was â between twenty and twenty-five feet.â The ram went down\n",
      "absolutely upright, with his head fully erect, and his feet well apart. He\n",
      "landed on the slide rock on his feet, broke no bones, promptly recovered himself\n",
      "and dashed away to safety. Judge Beaman declared that âthe dogs were afraid to\n",
      "approach even as near as the edge of the cliff at the point from which the sheep\n",
      "leaped off.â John Muir held the opinion that the legend of horn-landing sheep\n",
      "was born of the wild descent of frightened sheep down rocks so steep that they\n",
      "seemed perpendicular but were not, and the sheep, after touching here and there\n",
      "in the wild pitch sometimes landed in a heap at the bottom,âquite against\n",
      "their will. To me this has always seemed a reasonable explanation. The big-horn\n",
      "sheep has one mental trait that its host of ardent admirers little suspect. It\n",
      "does not like pinnacle rocks, nor narrow ledges across perpendicular cliffs, nor\n",
      "dangerous climbing. It does not âleap from crag to crag,â either up, down or\n",

      "camp. Hobbling along on foot we led a pack mule over half a mile of rough and\n",
      "terrible lava to a dead sheep. There we quickly skinned the animal, packed the\n",
      "skin and a horned head upon the upper deck of our mule, and started back to\n",
      "camp, leading our assistant. Half way back we looked westward across an eighth\n",
      "of a mile of rough, black lava, and saw standing on a low point a fine big-horn\n",
      "ram. He stood in a statuesque attitude, facing us, and fixedly gazing at us. He\n",
      "was trying to make out what we were, and to determine why a perfectly good pair\n",
      "of sheep horns should grow out of the back of a sorrel mule! Ethically he had a\n",
      "right to be puzzled. Mr. Milton and I were greatly annoyed by the absence of our\n",
      "rifles; and he proposed that we should leave the mule where he stood, go back to\n",
      "our camp, get our guns, and kill the sheep. Now, even then I was quite well up\n",
      "on the subject of curiosity in wild animals, and I knew to a minute what to\n",
      "count upon as the standing period of sheep, goat or deer. As gently as possible\n",
      "I informed Milton that no sheep would ever stand and look at a sorrel mule for\n",
      "the length of time it would take us to foot it over that lava to camp, and\n",
      "return. But my companion was optimistic, and even skeptical. âMaybe he will,\n",

      "fully twenty minutes. When we again reached the habitat of the mule, that ram\n",
      "was still there! Apparently he had not moved a muscle, nor stirred a foot, nor\n",
      "even batted an eye. Talk about curiosity in a wild animal! He was a living\n",
      "statue of it. He continued to hold his pose on his lava point while we stalked\n",
      "him under cover of a hillock of lava, and shot him,â- almost half an hour\n",
      "after we first saw him. He had been overwhelmingly puzzled by the uncanny sight\n",

      "Frakes took the idea into his head that he must catch some mountain sheep alive,\n",

      "âpossums, no matter what you do, or how badly you may hurt him, he will never\n",
      "flinch. And when this sheep (âOld Stonewallâ) was thrown down by the trap,\n",
      "he evidently thought that he was captured, and lay still for a few minutes\n",
      "before he found out the difference, which gave me time to come up with him. ...\n",
      "So I went to camp, got a trap clamp and some sacks, made a kind of sled and\n",
      "dragged him in. It was just midnight when I got him tied down, and just sun-up\n",
      "when I got to camp with him. I fixed him up the best I could, stood him up\n",
      "beside the other big-horn and took their pictures. He looked so ârough and\n",
      "readyâ that I named him âOld Stone- wall.â But for all his proud, defiant\n",

      "winter store, and carried all of it up into the seat of that buggy! The nest had\n",
      "been carefully re-made, and the seed placed close by, as before. Considering the\n",

      "their nest and seed, and transported them to New York. Now, the reasoning of\n",
      "those wonderful little creatures, in the face of new conditions, was perfectly\n",
      "obvious, (i) Finding themselves suddenly deprived of their winter home and store\n",
      "of food, (2) they scattered and fled for personal safety into the tall grass and\n",

      "ground floor upstairs, and hid them under a pillow on a bed. Then they took from\n",
      "the kitchen a tablespoonful of cucumber seeds and hid them in the pocket of a\n",
      "vest that hung upstairs on a nail. In one night they removed from box number\n",
      "one, eighty five pieces of bee-hive furniture, and hid them in another box. On\n",

      "relate stories innumerable of the absurd but industrious doings of these\n",

      "impossible to figure out by any rules known to me the workings of their minds.\n",
      "Strange to say, they are not fiends and devils of malice and destruction like\n",
      "the brown rat of civilization, and on the whole it seems that the destruction of\n",
      "valuable property is not by any means a part of their plan. They have a passion\n",
      "for moving things. Their vagaries seem to be due chiefly to caprice, and an\n",
      "overwhelming desire to keep exceedingly busy. I think that the animal\n",
      "psychologists have lost much by so completely ignoring these brain-busy animals,\n",
      "and I hope that in the future they will receive the attention they deserve. Why\n",

      "wooden house, which they might if they chose, entirely surround and snugly cover\n",
      "with mud and sticks. But would they accept it in a grateful spirit, and utilize\n",
      "it? One cannot always tell what a wild animal will do. With loose earth a low\n",
      "island with a flat top was built to carry the house. Its top was six inches\n",
      "above high-water mark, and (that would, if accepted) be the floor of the\n",
      "permanent house. A good, practicable tunnel was built to an under- water\n",
      "entrance. Upon that our men set a square, bottomless house of wood, with walls\n",

      "on October 28. For a week there were no developments. The beavers made no sign\n",
      "of approval or disapproval. And then things began to happen. On November 5 we\n",
      "saw a beaver carrying a small green branch into the house for bedding! That\n",
      "meant that our offering was going to be accepted. The subsequent chronology of\n",
      "that beaver house is as follows: Nov. 10. The beavers pulled all our brush away\n",
      "from the house, back to a distance of six or seven feet. The house stood fully\n",

      "mammalian mentality, the avian mind is much more elementary and primitive. It is\n",

      "to those of reptiles. Instinct Prominent in Birds, The average bird is more a\n",
      "creature of instinct than of reason. Primarily it lives and moves by and through\n",

      "and the things it has thought out in its own head. But let it not for one moment\n",
      "be supposed that the in- stinctive knowledge of the bird is of a mental quality\n",
      "inferior to that of. the mammal. The difference is in kind only, not in degree.\n",
      "As a factor in self-preservation the keen and correct reasoning of the farm-land\n",

      "avian intelligence. It is of interest chiefly to the birds of the temperate\n",

      "fed in winter, many of them would remain with us throughout the year. Consider\n",
      "the migratory habits of our own home favorites, and see what they reveal. After\n",
      "all else has been said, bird migration is the one unfathomable wonder of the\n",
      "avian world. Really, we know of it but little more than we know of the songs of\n",
      "the morning stars. We have learned when the birds start; we know that many of\n",
      "them fly far above the earth; we know where some of them land, and the bird\n",

      "about all that we do know? What courage it must take, to start on the long,\n",

      "existence in this rough and cruel world?â We understand well enough the\n",
      "foundation principles of mammalian and avian life, and existence under adverse\n",
      "cir- cumstances. The mammal is tied to his environment. He cannot go far from\n",
      "the circumpolar regions of his home. A bear chained to a stake is emblematic of\n",
      "the universal handicap on mammalian life. Survive or perish, the average\n",
      "land-going quadruped must stay put, and make the best of the home in which he is\n",
      "born. If he attempts to migrate fast and far, he is reasonably certain to get\n",
      "into grave danger, and lose his life. The bird, however, is a free moral agent.\n",
      "If the purple grackle does not like the sunflower seeds in my garden, lo! he is\n",
      "up and away across the Sound to Oyster Bay, Long Island, where his luck may be\n",
      "better. Failing there, he gives himself a transfer to Wilmington, or Richmond,\n",
      "via his own Atlantic coast line. The wonderful migratory instincts of birds have\n",
      "been devel- oped and intensified through countless generations by the imper-\n",
      "ative need for instinctive guidance, and the comparatively small temptation to\n",
      "inductive reasoning based on known facts. Evidently the bird is emboldened to\n",
      "migrate by the comfortable belief that somewhere the world contains food and\n",
      "warmth to its liking, and that if it flies fast enough and far enough it will\n",
      "find it. As a weather prophet, the prescience of the bird is strictly limited.\n",
      "The warm spells of late February deceive the birds just as they do the flowers\n",
      "of the peach tree and the apple. Often the bluebirds and robins migrate\n",
      "northward too early, encounter blizzards, and perish in large numbers from snow,\n",
      "sleet, cold and hunger. The Homing Sense of Birds, We can go no farther than to\n",
      "say that while the homing instinct of certain species of birds is quite well\n",
      "known, the mental process by which it functions is practically unknown. The\n",
      "direction instinct of the homing pigeon is marvelous, but we know that that\n",
      "instinct does not leap full-fledged from the nest. The homer needs assistance\n",
      "and training. When it is about three months old, it is taken in a basket to a\n",
      "point a mile distant from its home and liberated. If it makes good in returning\n",
      "to the home loft, the distances are increased by easy stagesâtwo, three, five,\n",
      "ten, twenty, thirty, fifty and seventy-five miles usually being flown before the\n",
      "bird is sent as far as 100 miles. The official long-distance record for a homing\n",
      "pigeon is 1689.44 miles, held by an American bird. The homing instinct, or\n",
      "sense, is present in some mammals, but it is by no means so phenomenal as in\n",
      "some species of birds. In mammals it is individual rather than species-wide.\n",
      "Indi- vidual horses, dogs and cats have done wonderful things under the\n",
      "propulsion of the homing instinct, but that instinct is by no means general\n",
      "throughout those species. Among wild animals, exhibitions of the home-finding\n",
      "instinct are rare, but the annals of the Zoological Park contain one amusing\n",
      "record. For emergency reasons, a dozen fallow deer once were quartered in our\n",
      "Bison range, behind a fence only sixty-six inches high. Presently they leaped\n",
      "out to freedom, disappeared in the thick northern forests of the Bronx, and we\n",
      "charged them up to profit and loss. But those deer soon found that life outside\n",
      "our domain was not the dream of paradise that they had supposed. After about a\n",
      "week of wandering through a cold, unsympathetic and oatless world those were\n",
      "sadder and wiser deer, and one night they all returned and joyously and\n",

      "reasoning, most birds,âif not indeed all of them,âare quick in discernment\n",

      "as colors are in fur or feathers. A vastly preponderating number of bird species\n",
      "are of sanguine temperament; and it is this fact alone that renders it possible\n",
      "for us to exhibit continuously from 700 to 800 species of birds. Sensible\n",

      "enter this chapter let us pause a moment on the threshold, and consider the\n",
      "logic of animal training and performances. Logic is only another name for\n",
      "reason. Its reverse side is fanaticism; and that way madness lies. It is the\n",
      "duty of every sane man and woman to consider the cold logic of every question\n",
      "affecting the welfare of man and nature. Fanaticism when carried to extremes can\n",
      "become a misdemeanor or a crime. The soft-hearted fanaticism of humanics that\n",
      "saves a brutal murderer, or would-be murderer like Berkman, from the gallows or\n",
      "the chair, and eventually turns him loose to commit more crimes against innocent\n",
      "people, is not only wrong, and wicked, but in aggravated cases it is a crime\n",
      "against society. Just now there is a tiny wave of agitation against all\n",
      "performances of trained wild animals, and the keeping of animals in captivity,\n",
      "on the ground that all this is âcruelâ and inhumane. The Jacklondon Society\n",
      "of Boston is working hard to get up steam for this crusade, but thus far with\n",
      "only partial success. Its influence is confined to a very small area. Now, what\n",
      "is the truth of this matter? Is it true that trained wild animals are cruelly\n",
      "abused in the training, or in compelling them to perform? Is it true that in\n",
      "making animals perform on the stage, or in the circus ring, their rights are\n",
      "wickedly infringed? Is it the duty of the American people to stop all\n",
      "performances by animals? Is it wicked to make wild animals, or cats and dogs,\n",
      "work for a living, as men and women do? Is it true that captive animals in\n",
      "zoological parks and gardens are miserable and unhappy, and that all such\n",
      "institutions should be âabolished?â What is truth? In the first place, there\n",
      "is no sound reasoning or logic in assuming that the persons of animals, tame or\n",
      "wild, are any more sacred than those of men, women and children. We hold that it\n",
      "is no more âcrueltyâ for an ape or a dog to work in training quarters or on\n",
      "the stage than it is for men, women and young people to work as acrobats, or\n",
      "actors, or to engage in honest toil eight hours per day. Who gave to any warm-\n",
      "blooded animal that consumes food and requires shelter the right to live without\n",
      "work? No one! I am sure that no trained bear of my acquaintance ever had to work\n",
      "as hard for his food and shelter as does the average bear out in the wilds. In\n",
      "order to find enough to eat the latter is compelled to hustle hard from dawn\n",
      "till dark. I have seen that the Rocky Moun- tain grizzly feels forced to dig a\n",
      "big hole three feet deep in hard, rocky ground, to get one tiny ground squirrel\n",
      "the size of a chipmunk,â-and weighing only eight or nine ounces. Now, has he\n",
      "anything âonâ the performing bear? Decidedly not. I regard the sentimental\n",
      "Jacklondon idea, that no wild animal should be made to work on the stage or in\n",
      "the show-ring, as illogical and absurd. Human beings who sanely work are much\n",
      "happier per capita than those who do nothing but loaf and grouch. I have worked,\n",
      "horse-hard, throughout all the adult years of my life; and it has been good for\n",
      "me. I know that it is no more wrong or wicked for a horse to work for his\n",
      "living,âof course on a humane basis,âeither on the stage or on the street,\n",
      "than it is for a coal-carrier, a foundryman, a farmer, a bookkeeper, a school\n",
      "teacher or a housewife to do the dayâs work. The person of a wild animal is no\n",
      "more sacred than is that of a man or woman. A sound whack for an unruly\n",
      "elephant, bear or horse is just as helpful as it is for an unruly boy who needs\n",

      "people who are spending time and energy in crusading against trained animal\n",
      "performances? The vast majority of performing animals are trained by humane men\n",
      "and women, practicing kindness to the utmost; and they are the last persons in\n",
      "the world who would be willing to have their valuable stock roughly handled,\n",
      "neglected or in any manner cruelly treated. So far as zoological parks and\n",
      "gardens are concerned, they are no more in need of defense than the Rocky\n",
      "Mountains. Every large zoological park is a school of wild-animal education and\n",
      "training; and it is literally a continuous per- formance. Let no one suppose\n",
      "that there is no training of wild beasts save for the circus ring and the\n",
      "vaudeville stage. Of the total number of large and important mammals that come\n",
      "into our zoological parks, the majority of them actually are trained to play\n",
      "becomingly their respective parts. An intractable and obstinate animal soon\n",
      "becomes a nuisance. The following, named in the order of their importance, are\n",
      "the species whose zoological park training is a matter of necessity: Elephants,\n",
      "bears, apes, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, giraffes, bison, musk-ox, wild sheep,\n",
      "goats and deer, African antelopes, wild swine, and wild horses, asses and\n",
      "zebras. Of large birds the most conspicuous candidates for training in park life\n",
      "are the ostriches, emus, cassowaries, cranes, pelicans, swans, egrets and\n",
      "herons, geese, ducks, pheasants, macaws and cockatoos, curassows, eagles and\n",
      "vultures. Among the reptiles, the best trained are the giant tortoises, the\n",
      "pythons, boas, alligators, crocodiles, iguanas and gopher snakes. Each one of\n",
      "these species is educated (i) to be peaceful, and not attack their keepers; (2)\n",
      "to not fear their keepers; (3) to do as they are bid about going here or there;\n",
      "(4) to accept and eat the food that is provided for them, and (5) finally, in\n",
      "some cases to âshow offâ a little when commanded, for the benefit of\n",
      "visitors. All this training comes in the regular course of our daily work, and\n",
      "there are few animals who do not respond to it. The necessity for training is\n",
      "most imperative with the ele- phants and bears, for without it the difficulties\n",
      "in the manage- ment of those dangerous animals is greatly intensified. In\n",
      "training an animal to do a particular act not in the routine of his daily life,\n",
      "it is of course necessary to show him clearly and pointedly what is desired. I\n",
      "think that in quick- ness of perception, and ability to adopt a new idea, the\n",
      "ele- phants and the great apes are tied for first place. Both are remarkably\n",
      "quick. It seems to me that it required only half a dozen lessons to teach our\n",
      "Indian elephant, Gunda, to take a penny in his trunk, lift the lid of a\n",
      "high-placed box, drop in the coin, then pull a bell-cord and ring a bell. Of\n",
      "course the reward for the first successful performances was lumps of sugar.\n",
      "Within three days this rather interesting special exhibit was working smoothly,\n",
      "and coining money. As a means of working off on the poor animal great numbers of\n",
      "foreign copper coins, and spurious issues of all kinds, it was a great boon to\n",
      "the foreign population of New York. Our erratic elephant Alice was quickly\n",
      "trained by Keeper Richards to blow a mouth organ, to ring a telephone by turning\n",
      "the crank, and to take off the receiver and hold it up to her ear for an\n",

      "various races of men. Naturally the animal trainer selects for training only\n",
      "those animals that are of amiable disposition, that mentally are alert,\n",
      "responsive and possessed of good memories. The worst mistakes they make are in\n",
      "taking on and forcing ill-natured and irritable animals, that hate training and\n",
      "performing. Often a trainer persists in retaining an animal that resolutely\n",
      "should be thrown out. Captain Bonavita lost his arm solely because of his fatal\n",
      "persistence in retaining in his group of lions an animal that hated him, and\n",
      "which the trainer well knew was dangerous. While nearly every wild animal can be\n",
      "taught a few simple tricks, the dull mind soon reaches its constitutional limit.\n",
      "Even among the great apes, conditions are quite the same. One half the\n",

      "Hagenbeck had great success in the pro- duction of large animal groups trained\n",
      "for stage performances. I came in close touch with his methods and their\n",
      "results. His methods were very simple, and they were founded on kindness and\n",
      "common sense. Mr. Hagenbeck hated whips and punish- ments. When an animal could\n",
      "not get on without them, it was dropped from the cast. His working theory was\n",
      "that an unwilling animal makes a bad actor. There is no mystery about the best\n",

      "dilatory, and was often the last one to finish. The other animals seemed to be\n",
      "fascinated by his mishaps, and they sat on their tubs and watched him with what\n",

      "Carl Hagenbeck loved to produce mixed groups of dangerous animals,âlions,\n",

      "Hagenbeck, brother of the great Carl, actually trained and performed with a huge\n",
      "herd of dangerous polars to the number stated. In the Strand magazine for April,\n",
      "1908, there is a fine article by Arthur Harold about this group and its\n",
      "production. It says that the bears were obtained when seven or eight months old,\n",
      "in large lots, and all thrown in together. It took a keeper between seven and\n",
      "eight months to educate them out of their savage state,âby contact, kindness,\n",
      "sugar and fruit,âand then they were turned over to the trainer, Mr. Hagenbeck.\n",
      "They were taught to form pyramids, climb lad- ders, shoot the chutes, ride in\n",
      "pony carriages, draw and ride in sleds, drink from bottles, and work a see-saw.\n",
      "Various individuals did individual tricks. The star performer was Monk, the\n",
      "wrestling bear, who went with his trainer through a fearsome wrestling\n",
      "performance. Concerning the temperament of that polar bear group Mr. William\n",
      "Hagenbeck said: â Although I know every animal in the company, have taught\n",
      "each one to recognize me, and have been among many of them for fifteen years, I\n",
      "can not now tell by their expressions the moods of the animals. This is one of\n",
      "the charactertistics of the polar bear. Their expression remains the same, and\n",
      "it is impossible to detect by watching their faces whether they are pleased or\n",
      "cross. Now in most wild animals, such as the lion, you can tell by the\n",
      "expression of the beastâs face and by its actions whether it is in a good\n",
      "temper or not. . . . The truth is, the polar bear is a most awkward beast to\n",
      "train. In the first place its character is difficult to understand. He is by\n",
      "nature very suspicious, and without the least warning is apt to turn upon his\n",
      "trainer. Among the seventy bears that have been taught to do tricks, only two of\n",
      "them are really fond of their work.â In the end, Mr. William Hagenbeck was\n",
      "very nearly killed by one of these polar bears. I was with Carl Hagenbeck a few\n",
      "hours after he received telegraphic news of the tragedy, and his bitterness\n",
      "against those polar bears was boundless. I understood that Monk, the wrestling\n",
      "bear, was the assailant, âwhich was small cause for wonder. When I saw Mr.\n",
      "Hagenbeckâs polar bear show, it gave me shivers of fear. The first two big\n",
      "male polars that we installed at our Park came from that very group, and one of\n",
      "them led us into a dreadful tragedy, with a female bear as the victim. The\n",
      "So-Called âTrickâ Performances. Some psychol- ogists make light of what they\n",
      "call âtrick performances,â in which the performing animals are guided by\n",
      "signs, or signals, or spoken commands from their trainers. I have never been\n",
      "able to account for this. It is incontestably true that dull and stupid animals\n",
      "can learn little, and perform less. For example, all the training in the world\n",
      "could not suffice to put a pig through a performance that a chimpanzee or orang\n",
      "could master in two weeks. The reason is that the pig has not the brain power\n",
      "that is indispensable. A woodchuck never could become the mental equal of a wood\n",

      "the reader may judge for himself: 1. Each sea-lion balanced upright on its nose\n",
      "a wooden staff 3 feet long, with a round knob on its upper end. 2. Each sea-lion\n",
      "caught in its mouth a three-foot stick with a ball on each end, tossed it up,\n",
      "whirled it in the air, and caught it again. This was repeated, without a miss.\n",
      "3. Each sea-lion balanced on the tip of its nose, first a ball like a baseball,\n",
      "then a large ball two feet in diameter. 4. Each sea-lion climbed a double ladder\n",
      "of eight steps, and went down on the other side, balancing a large ball on the\n",
      "end of its nose, without a miss. 5. The trainer handed a ball to the sea-lion\n",
      "nearest him, who balanced it on his nose, walked with it to his box and climbed\n",
      "up. 6. Then another sea-lion walked over to him, and waited expectantly until\n",

      "as a whole the school does know that number.â The performance was fairly\n",
      "bewildering; but by diligent work I recorded the whole of it. Various horses did\n",

      "trainerâs command, and in poor performances the command often requires to be\n",
      "repeated, two or three times, or more. The memory of the horse is not nearly so\n",
      "quick nor so certain as that of the chimpanzee or elephant. Dr. Martin J.\n",
      "Potter, of New York, famous trainer of stage and movie animals, states that of\n",
      "all animals, wild or domestic, the horse is the most intelligent; but I doubt\n",
      "whether he ever trained any chimpanzees. Speaking from out of the abundance of\n",
      "his training experience with many species of animals except the great apes, Dr.\n",
      "Potter says that âthe seal [i. e. California sea-lion] learns its stage cues\n",
      "more easily than any other mute performer. The horse, however, is the most\n",
      "intelligent of all animals in its grasp and understanding of the work it has\n",
      "learned to perform, and in its reliable faithfulness and memory.â Dr. Potter\n",
      "holds that of wild animals the tiger, owing to its treachery and ferocity, is\n",
      "the most difficult wild animal to train; the lion is the most reliable, and the\n",

      "time in our place, named DâOsta, once did a very neat piece of work in taming\n",
      "a savage and intractable chimpanzee. When Boma came to us, fresh from the French\n",
      "Congo, he was savage and afraid. He retreated to the highest resting-place of\n",
      "his cage, came down only at night for his meals, and would make no compromise.\n",
      "We believed that he had been fearfully abused by his former owners, and through\n",
      "mistreatment had acquired both fear and hatred of all men. After the lapse of\n",
      "several months with Boma on that basis, the situation grew tiresome and\n",
      "intolerable. So DâOsta said: âI must tame that animal, and teach him not to\n",
      "be afraid of us.â He introduced a roomy shifting cage into Bomaâs compart-\n",
      "ment, fixed the drop door, and for many days served Bomaâs food and water in\n",
      "that cage only. For two weeks the ape eluded capture, but eventually the keeper\n",
      "caught him. At first Bomaâs rage and fear were boundless; but presently the\n",
      "idea dawned upon his mind that he was not to be killed im- mediately. DâOsta\n",
      "handed him excellent food and water, twice a day, spoke to him soothingly, and\n",
      "otherwise let him alone. Slowly Bomaâs manner changed. He learned that he was\n",
      "not to be hurt, nor even annoyed. Confidence in the men about him began to come\n",
      "to him. His first signs of friendliness were promptly met and cultivated. At the\n",
      "end of ten days, DâOsta opened the sliding door, and Boma walked out, a wiser\n",
      "and better ape. His bad temper and his fears were gone. He trusted his keeper,\n",
      "and cheerfully obeyed him. Strangest of all, he even suffered DâOsta to put a\n",
      "collar upon him, and chain him to the front bars to curb his too great\n",
      "playfulness while his cage was being cleaned. Bomaâs fear of man has never\n",
      "returned. Now, although he is big and dangerous, he is a perfectly normal ape.\n",
      "The Training of an Over-Age Bear. A bear-trainer- athlete and â bear- wrestler\n",
      "â named Jacob Glass once taught me a lesson that astounded me. It related to\n",
      "the training of a bear that I thought was too old to be trained. We had an\n",
      "Alaskan cinnamon bear, three years old, that had been christened â\n",
      "Christian,â at Skagway, because it stood so much pestering without flying into\n",
      "rages, as the grizzly did. After a short time with us, the concrete floors of\n",
      "our bear dens reacted upon the soles of its feet so strangely and so seriously\n",
      "that we were forced to transfer the animal to a temporary cage that had a wooden\n",
      "floor. While I was wondering what to do with that bear, along came Mr. Glass,\n",
      "anxious and unhappy. âMy wrestling^bear has died on me,â he said, âand\n",
      "Iâve got to get another. You have got one that I would like to buy from you.\n",
      "Itâs the one you call Christian.â Very kindly I said, âThat is a mighty\n",
      "fine bear, as to temper; but now he is entirely too old to train, and you\n",
      "couldnât do anything with him. He would be a loss to you.â âIâve looked\n",
      "him over, and I like his looks. I think I can train him all right. You let me\n",
      "have him, and Iâll make a fine performer of him.â âI know that you never\n",
      "can do it; but you may try him, and send him back when you fail.â Thus ended\n",
      "the first lesson; and I was sure that in a month Mr. Glass would beg me to take\n",
      "back the untrainable animal. About one year later Glass appeared again,\n",
      "jubilant. At once he broke forth into eulogies of Christian; but one chapter\n",
      "would not be large enough to contain them. He had trained that bear, with\n",
      "outrageous ease and celerity, and had im- mediately taken him upon the stage as\n",
      "a professional jiu-jitsu wrestler. And really, the act was admirable. As a\n",

      "âRight, left, half-nelson, strangle, head up, nose under arm, and\n",
      "hammer-lock.â Glass declared that this bear was more intelligent than any\n",
      "lion, or any other trained animal ever seen by him. He was wise in many ways\n",
      "besides wrestling,âin his friendship with Glass, with other bears, with other\n",
      "men, and with a dog. He obeyed all orders willingly, even permitting Glass to\n",
      "take his food away when he was eating; but he would not stand being punished\n",
      "with a whip or a stick! In response to that he would bite. However, he\n",
      "generously permitted himself to be held down and choked, as a punishment, after\n",
      "which he would be very repentant, and would insist upon getting into his\n",
      "partnerâs lap,âto show his good will. Glass was enthusiastically certain\n",

      "had a number of Japanese red-faced monkeys, and one of the surplus adult males\n",
      "had a temper as red as his face. Mr. Wormwood, an exhibitor of performing\n",

      "that it would be im- possible to train it. At that implied challenge the trainer\n",
      "perked up and in- sisted upon having that particular bad animal; so we yielded.\n",
      "He wished him for the special business of turning somersaults, because he had no\n",

      "again. â Yes,â he said, but not boastfully, âI trained him\\ but I came\n",

      "ANIMALS HE ethics and morals of men and animals are thoroughly comparative, and\n",
      "it is only by direct comparisons that they can be analyzed and classified. It is\n",
      "quite possible that there are quite a number of intelligent men and women who\n",
      "are not yet aware of the fact that wild, animals have moral codes, and that on\n",
      "an average they live up to them better than men do to theirs. It is a painful\n",
      "operation to expose the grinning skeletons in the closets of the human family,\n",
      "but in no other way is it pos- sible to hold a mirror up to nature. With all our\n",
      "brightness and all our talents,âreal and imitation,âfew men ever stop to ask\n",
      "what our horses, dogs and cats think of our follies and our wickedness. By the\n",
      "end of the year 1921 the annual total of human wickedness had reached staggering\n",
      "proportions. From August 1914 to November 1918 the moral standing of the human\n",
      "race reached the lowest depth it ever sounded since the days of the\n",
      "cave-dwellers. This we know to be true, because of the increase in manâs\n",
      "capacity for wickedness, and its crop of results. After what we recently have\n",
      "seen in Europe and Asia, and on the high seas, let no man speak of a monster in\n",
      "human form as âa brute;â for so far as moral standing is concerned, some of\n",
      "the animals allegedly âbelow manâ now are in a position to look down upon\n",
      "him. It is a cold and horrid fact that today, all around us, and sometimes close\n",
      "at hand, men are committing a long list of ai9 revolting crimes such as even the\n",
      "most debased and cruel beasts of the field never commit. I refer to wanton\n",
      "wholesale murder, often with torture; assault with violence, robbery in a\n",
      "hundred cruel forms, and a dozen unmentionable crimes in- vented by degenerate\n",
      "man and widely practiced. If anyone feels that this indictment is too strong, I\n",
      "can cite a few titles that will be quite sufficient for my case. Let us make a\n",
      "few comparisons between the human species {Homo sapiens) and the so-called\n",
      "âlowerâ wild animals; and let it be understood that the author testifies, in\n",
      "courtroom phrase, only âto the best of his information and belief.â Only two\n",
      "wild animal species known to me,âwolves and crocodiles,â devour their own\n",
      "kind; but many of the races of men have been cannibals, and some are so today.\n",
      "Among free wild animals, the cruel abuse or murder of children by their parents,\n",
      "or by other adults of the tribe, is unknown; but in all the âcivilizedâ\n",
      "races of men infanticide and child murder are frightfully common crimes. In 1921\n",
      "a six-year-old Eskimo girl, whose father and mother had been murdered, was\n",
      "strangled by her relatives, because she had no visible means of support. The\n",
      "murder of the aged and helpless among wild animals is almost unknown; but among\n",
      "both the savage and the civilized races of men it is quite common. Our old\n",
      "acquaintance, Shack-Nasty Jim, the Modoc Indian, tomahawked his own mother\n",
      "because she hindered his progress; but many persons in and around New York have\n",
      "done worse than that. Civil war between the members of a wild animal species is\n",
      "a thing unknown in the annals of wild-animal history; but among men it is an\n",
      "every-day occurrence. Among free animals it is against the moral and ethical\n",
      "codes of all species of vertebrates for the strong to bully and oppress the\n",
      "weak; but it is almost everywhere a common rule of action with about ten per\n",
      "cent of the human race. The members of a wild animal species are in honor bound\n",
      "not to rob one another, but with 25 per cent of the men of all civilized races,\n",
      "robbery, and the desire to get something for nothing, are ruling passions. No\n",
      "wild animals thus far known and described practice sex crimes; but the less\n",
      ".said of the races of men on this subject, the better for our feelings. Among\n",
      "animals, save in the warfare of carnivorous animals for their daily food, there\n",
      "are no exterminatory wars between species, and even local wars over territory\n",
      "are of very rare occur- rence. Among men, the territorial wars of tribes and\n",
      "nations are innumerable, they have been from the earliest historic times, and\n",
      "they are certain to continue as long as this earth is inhabited by man. The\n",
      "âend of warâ between the grasping nations of this earth is an iridescent\n",
      "dream, because of the inextinguishable jealousy and meanness of nations; but it\n",
      "is well to reduce them to a minimum. Nations like Germany, Bulgaria, Turkey and\n",
      "Russia will never stand hitched for any long periods. Their peace-loving\n",
      "neighbors need to keep their weapons well oiled and polished, and indulge in no\n",
      "hallucina- tions of a millenium upon this wicked earth. In the mating season,\n",
      "there is fighting in many wild animal species between the largest and finest\n",
      "male individuals for the honor of overlordship in increasing and diffusing the\n",
      "species. These encounters are most noticeable in the various species of the deer\n",
      "family, because the fatal interlocking of antlers occa- sionally causes the\n",
      "death of both contestants. We have in our National Collection of Heads and Horns\n",
      "sets of interlocked antlers of moose, caribou, mule deer and white-tailed deer.\n",
      "Otherwise than from the accidental interlocking of antlers,â due to the fact\n",
      "that an animal can push forward with far greater force than it can pull\n",
      "back,âI have never seen, heard or read of a wild animal having been killed\n",
      "outright in a fight over the possession of females. Fur seal and Stellar\n",
      "sea-lion bulls, and big male orang-utans, frequently are found badly scarified\n",
      "by wounds received in fighting during the breeding season, but of actual deaths\n",
      "we have not heard. The first law of the jungle is: âLive, and let live.â\n",
      "Leaving out of account the carnivorous animals who must kill or die, all the\n",
      "wild vertebrate species of the earth have learned the logic that peace promotes\n",
      "happiness, prosperity and long life. This fundamentally useful knowledge governs\n",
      "not only the wild animal individual, but also the tribe, the species, and con-\n",
      "tiguous species. Do the brown bears and grizzlies of Alaska wage war upon each\n",
      "other, species against species? By no means. It seems reasonably certain that\n",
      "those species occasionally intermarry. Do the big sea-lions and the walruses\n",
      "seek to drive away or exterminate the neighboring fur seals or the helpless hair\n",
      "seals? Such warfare is absolutely unknown. Do the moose and caribou of Alaska\n",
      "and Yukon Territory attack the mountain sheep and goats? Never. Does the Indian\n",
      "elephant attack the gaur, the sambar, the axis deer or the muntjac? The idea is\n",
      "preposterous. Does any species of giraffe, zebra, antelope or buffalo attack any\n",
      "other species on the same crowded plains of British East Africa? If so, we have\n",
      "yet to learn of it. If the races and nations of men were as peace-loving, honest\n",
      "and sensible in avoiding wars as all the wild animal species are, then would we\n",
      "indeed have a social heaven upon earth. Now, tell me, ye winged winds that blow\n",
      "from the four corners of the earth and over the seven seas, whence came the\n",
      "Philosophy of Peace to the worldâs wild animals? Did they learn it by\n",
      "observing the ways of man? âIt is to laugh,â says the innkeeper. Man has not\n",
      "yet learned it himself; and there- fore do we find the beasts of the field a lap\n",
      "ahead of the quarrel- some biped who has assumed dominion over them. Day by day\n",
      "we read in our newspapers of men and women who are moral lepers and utterly\n",

      "newspapers. Said the Count to Julia in âThe Hunchback,â âDost thou like\n",
      "the picture, dearest?â As a natural historian, it is our task to hew to the\n",
      "line, and let the chips fall where they will. Among the wild animals there are\n",
      "but few degenerate and unmoral species. In some very upright species there are\n",
      "occasionally individual lapses from virtue. A famous case in point is the rogue\n",
      "elephant, who goes from meanness to mean- ness until he becomes unbearable. Then\n",
      "he is driven out of the herd; he becomes an outcast and a bandit, and he upsets\n",
      "carts, maims bullocks, tears down huts and finally murders natives until the\n",
      "nearest local sahib gets after him, and ends his career with a bullet through\n",
      "his wicked brain. In my opinion the gray wolf of North America (like his\n",
      "congener in the Old World) is the most degenerate and unmoral mammal species on\n",
      "earth. He murders his wounded pack- mates, he is a greedy cannibal, he will\n",
      "attack his wife and chew her unmercifully. On the other hand, his one redeeming\n",
      "trait is that he helps to rear the pups,âwhen they are successfully defended\n",
      "from him by their mother! The wolverine makes a specialty of devilish and\n",
      "uncanny cunning and energy in destroying the property of man. Trap- pers have\n",
      "told us that when a wolverine invades a trapperâs cabin in his absence, he\n",

      "carry away he defiles in such a manner that the hungriest man is unable to eat\n",
      "it. This seems to be a trait of this species only,âamong wild animals; but\n",
      "during the recent war it was asserted that similar acts were committed by\n",
      "soldiers in the captured and occupied villas of northern France. The\n",

      "under cover of darkness. Sometimes his cunning is almost beyond belief. Now, can\n",
      "anyone tell us how much of this particular evolution is due to the influence of\n",
      "Man upon Dog through a hundred generations of captivity and association? Has the\n",
      "dog learned from man the science of moral banditry, the best methods for the\n",
      "concealment of evi- dence, and how to dissemble? Elsewhere a chapter is devoted\n",
      "to the crimes of wild animals; but the great majority of the cases cited were\n",
      "found among captive animals, where abnormal conditions produced excep- tional\n",
      "results. The crimes of captive animals are many, but the crimes of free wild\n",
      "animals are comparatively few. When- ever we disturb the delicate and precise\n",
      "balance of nature we may expect abnormal results. XIX THE LAWS OF THE FLOCKS AND\n",
      "THE HERDS HROUGH a thousand generations of breeding and living under natural\n",
      "conditions, and of self-maintenance against enemies and evil conditions, the\n",
      "wild flocks and herds of beasts and birds have evolved a short code of com-\n",
      "munity laws that make for their own continued existence. And they do more than\n",
      "that. When free from the evil influences of man, those flock-and-herd laws\n",
      "promote, and actually produce, peace, prosperity and happiness. This is no\n",
      "fantastic theory of the friends of animals. It is a fact, just as evident to the\n",
      "thinking mind as the presence of the sun at high noon. The first wild birds and\n",
      "quadrupeds found themselves beset by climatic conditions of various degrees and\n",
      "kinds of rigor and destructive power. In the torrid zone it took the form of\n",
      "excessive rain and humidity, excessive heat, or excessive dryness and aridity.\n",
      "In the temperate and frigid zones, life was a seasonal battle with bitter cold,\n",
      "torrents of cold rain in early winter or spring, devastating sleet, and deep\n",
      "snow and ice that left no room for argument. At the same time, the species that\n",
      "were not predatory found themselves surrounded by fangs and claws, and the\n",
      "never- ending hunger of their owners. The air, the earth and the waters swarmed\n",
      "with predatory animals, great and small, ever seeking for the herbivorous and\n",
      "granivorous species, and preferably those that were least able to fight or to\n",
      "flee. The La Brea fossil beds at Los Angeles, wherein a hospitable lake of warm\n",
      "asphalt conserved skeletal remains of vertebrates to an extent and perfection\n",
      "quite unparalleled, have revealed some very remarkable conditions. The enormous\n",
      "output, up to date, of skulls of huge lions, wolves, sabre-toothed tigers, bears\n",
      "and other predatory animals, shows, for once, just what the camels, llamas,\n",
      "deer, bison and mammoths of those days had to do, to be, and to suffer in order\n",
      "to survive. With the aid of a little serious study, it is by no means diffi-\n",

      "goats, deer, antelope, gazelles, fur-seal, walrus and others to survive and\n",
      "increase. From the wild animal herds and bird flocks that we have seen and\n",
      "personally known, we know what their laws are, and can set them down in the\n",
      "order of their evolution and importance. The First Law. There shall be no\n",
      "fighting in the family, the herd or the species, at any other time than in the\n",
      "mating season; and then only between adult males who fight for herd leadership.\n",
      "The destructiveness of intertribal warfare, either organized or desultory, must\n",
      "have been recognized in Jurassic times, millions of years ago, by the reptiles\n",
      "of that period. Through- out the animal kingdom below man the blessings of peace\n",
      "now are thoroughly known. This first law is obeyed by all species save man. We\n",
      "doubt whether all the testimony of the rocks added together can show that one\n",
      "wild species of vertebrate life ever really was exterminated by another species,\n",
      "not even excepting the predatory species which lived by killing. No one (so far\n",
      "as we know) has charged that the lions, ^or the tigers, the bears, the orcas,\n",
      "the eagles or the owls have ever obliterated a species during historic times. It\n",
      "was the swine of civilization, transplanted by human agencies, that ex-\n",

      "prey, who swept off the earth the great auk, the passenger pigeon and a dozen\n",
      "other bird species. The Second Law. The strong members of a dock or herd shall\n",
      "not bully nor oppress the weak. This law, constantly broken by degenerate and\n",
      "vicious men, women and children, very rarely is broken in a free wild herd or\n",

      "mankind is far behind the wild animals. It would serve a good purpose if the\n",

      "this subject with a feeling of satisfac- - tion; but I would not like to state\n",
      "the number of hours that I have spent in watching the play of our wild animals.\n",
      "Out in the wilds, where the bears, sheep and goats live and thrive, the\n",
      "outdoorsmen see comparatively few wild animals at play. No matter what the\n",
      "season, the dangers of the wilderness and mountain summit remain the same. When\n",
      "kids and lambs are young, the eaglets are hungriest, and their mothers are most\n",
      "determined in their hunting. After Sep- tember i, the deadly still-hunters are\n",
      "out, and strained watch- fulness is the unvarying rule, from dawn until dark.\n",
      "Out in the wilds, it is the moving animal that instantly catches every hostile\n",
      "eye within visual range. A white goat kid vigorously gamboling on the bare rocks\n",
      "would attract all the golden eagles, hunters, trappers and Indians within a\n",
      "radius of two miles. It is the rule that kids, fawns and lambs must lie low and\n",
      "keep still, to avoid attracting deadly enemies. On the bare summits, play can be\n",
      "indulged in only at great risk. Generations of persecution have implanted in the\n",
      "brain of the ruminant baby the commanding instinct to fold up its long legs,\n",
      "neatly and compactly, furl its ears along its neck, and closely lie for hours\n",
      "against a rock or a log. During daylight hours they must literally hug the\n",
      "ground. Silence and inactivity is the first price that all young animals in the\n",
      "wilds pay for their lives. It is only in the safe shelter of captivity, or\n",
      "man-made sanctuaries, that they are free to play. In the comfortable security of\n",
      "the âzooâ all the wild condi- tions are changed. The restraints of fear are\n",
      "off, and every animal is free to act as joyous as it feels. Here we see things\n",
      "that men never see in the wilds! If any Rocky Mountain bear hunter should ever\n",
      "see bear cubs or full-grown bears wrestling and carrying on as they do here, he\n",
      "would say that they were plumb crazy! Of all our wild animals, not even\n",
      "excepting the apes and monkeys, our young bears are the most persistently\n",
      "playful. In fact, I believe that when properly caged and tended, bears under\n",
      "eight years of age are the most joyous and playful of all wild animals. We have\n",
      "given our bears smooth and spacious yards floored with concrete, with a deep\n",
      "pool in the centre of each, and great possibilities in climbing upon rocks high\n",
      "and low. The top of each sleeping den is a spacious balcony with a smooth floor.\n",
      "The facilities for bear wrestling and skylarking are perfect, and there are no\n",
      "offensive uneven floors nor dead stone walls to annoy or discourage any bear.\n",
      "They can look at each other through the entire series of cages and there is no\n",
      "chance whatever for a bear to feel lonesome. We put just as many individuals\n",
      "into each cage as we think the traffic will stand; and sometimes as many as six\n",
      "young bears are reared together. Now, all these conditions promote good spirits,\n",
      "playfulness, and the general enjoyment of life. Any one who thinks that our\n",
      "bears are not far happier than those that are in the wilds and exposed to\n",
      "enemies, hunger and cold, should pause and con- sider. Our bear cubs begin to\n",
      "play just as soon as they emerge from their natal den, in March or April, and\n",
      "they keep it up until they are six or seven years of age,âor longer! Our\n",
      "visitors take the playfulness of small cubs as a matter of course, but the\n",
      "clumsy and ridiculous postures and antics of fat-paunched full- grown bears are\n",
      "irresistibly funny. Really, there are times when it seems as if the roars of\n",
      "laughter from the watching crowd stimulates wrestling bears to further efforts.\n",
      "On October 28, 1921, about seventy boys stood in front of and alongside the\n",
      "ADULT BEARS AT PLAY % den of two Kluane grizzly cubs and shouted for nearly half\n",
      "an hour in approval and admiration of the rapid and rough play of those cubs.\n",
      "The play of bears, young or middle-aged, consists in boxing, catch-as-catch-can\n",
      "wrestling, and chasing each other to and fro. Cubs begin to spar as soon as they\n",
      "are old enough to stand erect on their hind feet. They take their distance as\n",
      "naturally as prize-fighters, and they strike, parry and dodge just as men do.\n",
      "They handle their front feet with far more dexterity and precision than boys six\n",
      "years of age. Boxing bears always strike for the head, and bite to seize the\n",
      "cheek of the opponent. In biting, mouth meets mouth, in defense as well as\n",
      "attack. When a biting bear makes a suc- cessful pass and finally succeeds in\n",
      "getting a firm toothhold on the cheek of his opponent, the party of the second\n",
      "part promptly throws himself prone upon the ground, and with four free feet\n",
      "concentrated upon the head of the other bear forces him to let go. This\n",
      "movement, and the four big, flat foot soles coming up into action is, in large\n",
      "bears, a very laughable spectacle, and generally produces a roar. Wrestling\n",
      "bears roll over and over on the ground, clawing and biting, until one scrambles\n",
      "up, and either makes a new attack or rushes away. Bears love to chase one\n",
      "another, and be chased; and in this form of skylarking they raise a whirlwind of\n",
      "activity which leads all around the floor, up to the balcony and along the\n",
      "length of it, and plunges down at the other end. Often a bear that is chased\n",
      "will fling himself into the bathing pool, with a tre- mendous splash, quickly\n",
      "scramble out again and rush off anew in a swirl of flying water. The two big\n",
      "male polar bears that came to us from the William Hagenbeck group were very fond\n",
      "of playing and wrest- ling in the water of their swimming pool. Often they kept\n",
      "up that aquatic skylarking for two hours at a stretch, and by this constant claw\n",
      "work upon each otherâs pelts they kept their coats of hair so thinned down\n",
      "that we had to explain them. One bear had a very spectacular swimming trick. He\n",
      "would swim across the pool until his front feet touched the side, then he would\n",
      "throw himself over backwards, put his hind feet against the rock wall, and with\n",
      "a final shove send himself floating gracefully on his back across to the other\n",
      "side. Playful bears are much given to playing tricks, and teasing each other. A\n",
      "bear sleeping out in the open den is regarded as a proper subject for hectoring,\n",
      "by a sudden bite or cuff, or a general assault. It is natural to expect that\n",
      "wrestling bears will frequently become angry and fight; but such is not the\n",
      "case. This often happens with boys and men, but bears play the game consistently\n",
      "to the end. I can not recall a single instance 01 a real bear fight as the\n",
      "result of a wrestling or boxing match; and may all boys take note of this good\n",
      "example from the bear dens. Next to the bears, the apes and monkeys are our most\n",
      "play- ful animals. Here, also, it is the young and the half grown members of the\n",
      "company that are most active in play. Fully mature animals are too sedate, or\n",
      "too heavy, for the frivolities of youth. A well-matched pair of young\n",
      "chimpanzees will wrestle and play longer and harder than the young of any other\n",
      "primate species known to me. It is important to cage together only young apes of\n",
      "equal size and strength, for if there is any marked disparity in size, the\n",
      "larger and stronger animal will wear out the strength of its smaller cage-mate,\n",
      "and impair its health. In playing, young chimps, orangs or monkeys seize each\n",
      "other and wrestle, fall, and roll over and over, indefinitely. They make great\n",
      "pretenses of biting each other, but it is all make-believe. My favorite\n",
      "orang-utan pet in Borneo loved to play at biting me, but whenever the pressure\n",
      "became too strong I would say chidingly, â Ah! Ah!â and his jaws would\n",
      "instantly relax. He loved to butt me in the chest with his head, make wry faces,\n",
      "and make funny noises with his lips. I tried to teach him â catâs cradleâ\n",
      "but it was too much for him. His clumsy fingers could not manage it. One of our\n",
      "brightest chimpanzees, named Baldy, was much given to hectoring his female\n",
      "cage-mate, for sport. What he regarded as his best joke was destroying her bed.\n",
      "Many times over, after she had laboriously carried straw up to the balcony,\n",
      "carefully made up a nice, soft, circular bed for herself, and settled down upon\n",
      "it for a well-earned rest, Baldy would silently climb up to her level, suddenly\n",
      "fling himself upon her as she lay, and with all four of his arms and legs\n",
      "violently working, the nest would be torn to pieces and scattered and the lady\n",
      "orang rudely pulled about. Then Baldy would joyously swing down to the lower\n",
      "level, settle himself demurely at the front of the cage, and with a placid face\n",
      "and innocent, far-away expression in his eyes gaze at the crowd. There was\n",
      "nothing lacking but a mischievous wink of one eye. Whenever his cage-mate\n",
      "selected a particularly long and perfect straw and placed it crosswise in her\n",
      "mouth, Baldy would steal up behind her and gleefully snatch it away. Baldy was a\n",
      "born comedian. He loved to amuse a crowd and make people laugh. He would go\n",
      "through a great trapeze performance of clownish and absurd gymnastics, and often\n",
      "end it with three or four loud smacks of his big black feet against the wall.\n",
      "This was accomplished by violent kicking backwards. His dancing and up-and-down\n",
      "jumping always made visitors laugh, after which he would joyously give his\n",
      "piercing âWah- hooâ shout of triumph. A Sioux Indian squaw dances by jump-\n",
      "ing up and down, but her performance is lifeless in comparison. No vaudeville\n",

      "when- ever he becomes especially desirous of entertaining a party of\n",
      "distinguished visitors. In stiff dancing posture, he leaps high in the air,\n",
      "precisely like a great black jumping-jack straight from Danteâs Inferno.\n",
      "Orangs love to turn somersaults, and some individuals are so persistent about it\n",
      "as to wear the hair off their backs, disfigure their beauty, and disgust their\n",
      "keepers. In the chapter on â Mental Traits of the Gorillaâ a descrip- tion\n",
      "is given of the play of Major Pennyâs wonderful John Gorilla. When many\n",
      "captive monkeys are kept together in one large cage containing gymnastic\n",
      "properties, many species develop humor, and indulge in play of many kinds. They\n",
      "remind me of a group of well-fed and boisterous small boys who must skylark or\n",
      "âbust.â From morning until night they pull each otherâs tails, wrestle and\n",
      "roll, steal each otherâs playthings, and wildly chase each other to and fro.\n",
      "There is no end of chattering, and screeching, and funny facial grimaces. A\n",
      "writer in Life once said that the sexes of monkeys can be distinguished by the\n",
      "fact that âthe females chatter twice as fast as the males,â but I am sure\n",
      "that many ladies will dispute that statement. In a company of mixed monkeys, or\n",
      "a mixed company of monkeys, a timid and fearsome individual is often made the\n",
      "butt of practical jokes by other monkeys who recognize its weakness. And who has\n",
      "not seen the same trait revealed in crowds of boys? But we can linger no longer\n",
      "with the Primates. Who has not seen squirrels at play? Once seen, such an\n",
      "incident is not soon forgotten. I have seen gray, fox and red squirrels engage\n",
      "in highly interesting performances. The gray squirrel is stately and beautiful\n",
      "in its play, but the red squirrel is amazing in its elaborateness of method. I\n",
      "have seen a pair of those mischief-makers perform low down on the trunk of a\n",
      "huge old virgin white oak tree, where the holding was good, and work out a\n",
      "program almost beyond belief. They raced and chased to and fro, up, down and\n",
      "across, in circles, triangles, parabolas and rectangles, until it was fairly\n",
      "bewildering. Really, they seemed to move just as freely and certainly on the\n",
      "tree-trunk as if they were on the ground, with no such thing in sight as the law\n",
      "of gravitation. It seems to me that the gray squirrel barks and the red squirrel\n",
      "chatters, scolds, and at times swears, chiefly for the fun of hearing himself\n",
      "make a noise. In the red squirrel it is impudent and defiant; and usually you\n",
      "hear it near your camp, or in your own grounds, where the rascals know that they\n",
      "will not be shot. The playful spirit seems to be inherent in the young of all\n",
      "the Felidae. The playfulness of lion, tiger, leopard and puma cubs is\n",

      "steep toboggan slide of wet and slippery earth to a water plunge at the bottom,\n",
      "is well known to trappers, hunters, and a few naturalists. It is quite\n",
      "celebrated, and is on record in many places. I have seen otter slides, but never\n",
      "had the good luck to see one in use. The otters indulge in this very genuine\n",
      "sport with just as much interest and zest as boys develop in coasting over ice\n",
      "and snow with their sleds. Here at the Zoological Park, young animals of a\n",
      "number of species amuse themselves in the few ways that are open to them. It is\n",
      "a common thing for fawns and calves of various kinds to butt their mothers, just\n",
      "for fun. A more common form of infantile ruminant sport is racing and jumping.\n",
      "Now and then we see a red buffalo calf three or four months old suddenly begin a\n",
      "spell of running for amusement, in the pure exuberance of health and good\n",
      "living. A calf will choose a long open course, usually up and down a gentle\n",

      "Years ago, in the golden days, I was so lucky as to see several times wonderful\n",
      "dances of flocks of saras cranes on the low sandy islets in the River Jumna,\n",
      "northern India, just below Etawah. It was like this: While the birds are idly\n",
      "stepping about, apropos of nothing at all, one suddenly flaps his long wings\n",
      "several times in succession, another jumps straight up in the air for a yard or\n",
      "so, and presto! with one accord the whole flock is galvanized into action. They\n",
      "throw aside their dignity, and real fun begins. Some stand still, heads high up,\n",
      "and flap their wings many times. Others leap in the air, straight up and down,\n",
      "one jump after another, as high as they can go. Others run about bobbing and\n",
      "bowing, and elaborately courtesying to each other with half opened wings,\n",
      "breasts low down and their tails high in the air, cutting very ridiculous\n",
      "figures. In springtime in the Zoological Park we often see similar exhibitions\n",
      "of crane play in our large crane paddock. A par- ticularly joyous bird takes a\n",
      "fit of running with spread wings, to and fro, many times over, and usually one\n",
      "bird thus per- forming inspires another, probably of his own kind, to join in\n",

      "trumpets his approval. In his new book, âThe Friendly Arctic,â Mr.\n",
      "Vilhjalmur Stefansson records an interesting example of play indulged in jointly\n",
      "by a frivolous arctic fox and eight yearling barren- ground caribou. It was a\n",
      "game of tag, or its wild equivalent. The fox ran into and through the group of\n",
      "caribou fawns, which gave chase and tried to catch the fox, but in vain. At last\n",
      "the fawns gave up the chase, returned to their original position, and came to\n",
      "parade rest. Then back came the fox. Again it scurried through the group in a\n",
      "most tantalizing manner, which soon provoked the fawns to chase the fox anew. At\n",
      "the end of this inning the caribou again abandoned the chase, whereupon the fox\n",
      "went off to attend to other affairs. On the whole, the play of wild animals is a\n",
      "large field and no writer will exhaust it with one chapter. Very sincerely do we\n",
      "wish that at least one of the many romance writers who are so industriously\n",
      "inventing wild-animal blood-and-thunder stories would do more work with his eyes\n",
      "and less with his imagination. XXI COURAGE IN WILD ANIMALS EITHER in wild\n",
      "animals or tame men, courage is the moral impulse that impels an individual to\n",
      "fight or to venture at the risk of bodily harm. Like Theodore Roosevelt, the\n",
      "truly courageous individual engages his ad- versary without stopping to consider\n",
      "the possible consequences to himself. The timid man shrinks from the onset while\n",
      "he takes counsel of his fears, and reflects that âIt may injure me in my\n",
      "business,1â or that âIt may hurt my standing;â and in the end he becomes a\n",
      "slacker. Among the mental traits and passions of wild creatures, a quantitative\n",
      "and qualitative analysis of courage becomes a highly interesting study. We can\n",
      "easily fall into the error of considering that fighting is the all-in-all\n",
      "measure of courage; which very often is far from being true. The mother quail\n",
      "that pretends to be wounded and feigns helplessness in order to draw hostile\n",
      "attention unto herself and away from her young, thereby displays courage of a\n",
      "high order. No quail unburdened by a helpless brood requiring her protection\n",
      "ever dreams of taking such risks. The gray gibbons of Borneo, who quite success-\n",
      "fully made their escape from us, but promptly returned close up to my party in\n",
      "response to the S. 0. S. cries of a captured baby gibbon, displayed the sublime\n",
      "courage of parental affec- tion, and of desperation. Wary, timid and fearfully\n",
      "afraid of man, at the first sight of a biped they swing away. At the first roar\n",
      "of a gun they literally fly down hill through the treetops, and vanish in a wild\n",
      "panic. And yet, the leading members of that troop halted and swiftly came back,\n",
      "piercing the gloom and silence of the forest with their shrill cries of mingled\n",
      "en- couragement and protest. It was quite as courageous and heroic as the act of\n",
      "a father who rushes into a burning building to save his child, at the imminent\n",
      "risk of his own life. The animal world has its full share of heroes. Also, it\n",
      "has its complement of pugilists and bullies, its cowards and its assassins. Few\n",
      "indeed are the wild creatures that fight gratuitously, or attack other animals\n",
      "without cause. If a fight occurs, look for the motive. The wild creatures know\n",
      "that peace promotes happiness and long life. Now, of all wild quadrupeds, it is\n",
      "probable that the African baboons are pound for pound the most pugnacious, and\n",
      "the quickest on the draw. The old male baboon in his prime will fight anything\n",
      "that threatens his troop, literally at the drop of a hat. But there is method in\n",
      "his madness. He and his wives and children dwell on the ground in lands\n",
      "literally reeking with fangs and claws. He has to confront the lion, leopard,\n",
      "wild dog and hyena, and make good his right to live. No wonder, then, that his\n",
      "temper is hot, his voice raucous and blood-curdling; his canines fearfully long\n",
      "and sharp, and his savage yell of warning sufficient to keep even the king of\n",
      "beasts off his grass. Once I saw two baboons fight. We had two huge and splendid\n",
      "adult male gelada baboons, from Abyssinia. They were kept separate, but in\n",
      "adjoining cages; and the time came when we needed one of those cages for another\n",
      "distinguished arrival. We decided to try the rather hazardous experiment of\n",
      "herding those two geladas together. Accordingly, we first opened the doors to\n",
      "both outside cages, to afford for the moment a free circulation of baboons, and\n",
      "then we opened the partition door. Instantly the two animals rushed together in\n",
      "raging combat. With a fierce grip each seized the other by the left cheek; and\n",
      "then began a baboon cy- clone. They spun around on their axis, they rolled over\n",
      "and over on the floor, and they waltzed in speechless rage over every foot of\n",
      "those two cages. Strange to say, beyond coughing and gasping they made no\n",
      "sounds. Never before had we witnessed such a fearsome exhibition of insane\n",
      "hatred and rage. As soon as the horrified spectators could bring it about, the\n",
      "wild fighters were separated; and strange to say, neither of them was seriously\n",
      "injured. It was a drawn battle. It is quite difficult to weigh and measure the\n",
      "independent and abstract courage inherent in any wild animal species. All that\n",
      "can be done is to grope after the truth. On this subject there can be almost as\n",
      "many different opinions as there are species of wild animals. What animal will\n",
      "go farthest in daring and defying man, even the man with a gun, in foraging for\n",
      "food? Unquestionably and indisputably, the lion. This is no idle repetition of\n",
      "an old belief, or tradition. It is a fact; and we say this quite mindful of the\n",
      "records made by the grizzly bear, the Alaskan brown bear, the tiger, the leopard\n",
      "and the jaguar. âThe Man-Eaters of Tsavoâ opened up a strange and new\n",

      "touch, and fortu- nately it did not quite end in a tragedy. This is what hap-\n",
      "pened : CoL Patterson and his staff decided to try to catch the boldest of the\n",
      "lions in a trap baited with a living man. Accord- ingly a two-room trap was\n",
      "built, one room to hold and protect the man-bait, the other to catch and hold\n",
      "the lion. A very courageous native consented to be âit,â and he was put in\n",
      "place and fastened up. The lion came on schedule time, he found the live bait,\n",
      "boldly entered the trap to seize it, and the dropping door fell as advertised.\n",
      "When the lion found himself caught, did his capture trouble him? Not in the\n",
      "least. Instead of starting in to tear his way out he decided to postpone his\n",
      "escape until he had torn down the partition and eaten the man! So at the\n",
      "partition he went, with teeth and claws. In mortal terror the live bait yelled\n",
      "for succor. In âthe last analysisâ the man was saved from the lion, but the\n",
      "lion joyously tore his way out and escaped without a scratch. So far from being\n",

      "exploits in scaring pioneers, in attacking hunters, in robbing camps, and\n",
      "finally in bear-handling and almost killing two guides in the Yellowstone Park,\n",
      "is long and thrilling. The record reaches back to the days of Lewis and Clark,\n",
      "who related many wild adventures with bears. The grizzlies of their day were\n",
      "very courageous, but even then they were not greatly given to attacking men\n",
      "quite unprovoked! In those days of bow-and-arrow Indians, and of white men armed\n",
      "only with ineffective muzzle-loading pea rifles, using only weak black powder,\n",
      "the grizzlies had an even chance with their human adversaries, and sometimes\n",
      "they took first money. In those days the courage of the grizzly was at its\n",
      "highest peak; and it was then conceded by all frontiersmen that the grizzly was\n",
      "thoroughly courageous, and always ready to fight. In the light of subsequent\n",
      "history, and in order to be just to the grizzly, we claim that his fighting was\n",
      "in self defense, for even in those days the unwounded bear preferred to run\n",
      "rather than to fight unnecessarily. The rise of the high-power, long-range\n",
      "repeating rifle has made the grizzly bear a different animal from what he was in\n",
      "the days of Lewis and Clark. He has learned, thoroughly, the supreme deadliness\n",
      "of manâs new weapons, and he knows that he is no longer able to meet men on\n",
      "even terms. Consequently, he runs, he hides, he avoids man, everywhere save in\n",

      "bear cub is introduced to a den of its peers, the newcomer shrinks in fright,\n",
      "and cowers, and takes its place right humbly. But species alter cases. Once when\n",
      "we re- ceived an eight-months-old grizzly cub we turned it loose in a big den\n",
      "that contained five black bear cubs a year older than itself. But did the\n",
      "grizzly cub cower and shrink? By no man- ner of means. With head fully erect, it\n",
      "marched calmly to the centre of the den, and with serene confidence gave the\n",

      "answer to the challenge, an eighteen-months- old black bear presently sidled up\n",
      "and made a trial blow at the grizzlyâs head. Instantly the grizzly cubâs\n",
      "right arm shot out a well-delivered blow that sent the black one scurrying away\n",
      "in a panic, and perceptibly cleared the atmosphere. That cub had grizzly-bear\n",
      "courage and confidence; that was all. There are a number of American sportsmen\n",
      "who esteem the Cape buffalo as the most aggressive and dangerous wild animal in\n",

      "markable cases of rage, resentment and fighting courage in a newly captured wild\n",
      "animal occurred near Buttonwillow, California, in November 1904, and is very\n",
      "graphically described by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the Scientific Monthly for\n",
      "November 1921. The story concerns the leader of a band of the small California\n",
      "Valley Elk (<Cervus nannodes) which it was desired to transport to Sequoia Park,\n",
      "for permanent preservation. The bull refused to be driven to the corral for\n",
      "capture, so he was roped, thrown, hog-tied and hauled six miles on a wagon. This\n",
      "indignity greatly enraged the animal. At the corral he was liberated for the\n",
      "purpose of driving him through a chute and into a car. From his capture and the\n",
      "jolting ride the bull was furious, and he refused to be driven. His first act\n",
      "was to gore and mortally wound a young elk that unfortunately found itself in\n",
      "the corral with him. Then he was roped again and his horns were sawn off. At\n",
      "first no horseman dared to ride into the corral to attempt to drive the animal.\n",
      "Finally the leader of the cowboys, Bill Woodruff, mounted on a wise and powerful\n",
      "horse who knew the game quite as well as his rider, rode into the corral with\n",
      "the raging elk, and attempted to drive it. The story of the fight that followed,\n",
      "of raging elk vs. horse and man, makes stories of Spanish bullfights seem tame\n",
      "and commonplace, and the adventure of St. George and the dragon a dull affair.\n",
      "With the stubs of his antlers the bull charged the horse again and again,\n",
      "inflicting upon the splendid animal heart-rending punishment. Finally, after a\n",
      "fearful conflict, the wise and brave horse conquered, and the elk devil was\n",
      "forced into the car. After a short railway journey the elk was forced into a\n",
      "crate,âfighting at every step,âand hauled a two daysâ journey to the Park.\n",
      "Reduced to kicking as its sole expression of resentment, the animal kicked\n",
      "continuously for forty-eight hours, almost demolishing the crate. The final\n",
      "scene of this unparalleled drama of wild-animal rage is thus described by Dr.\n",
      "Merriam: âThen the other gates were raised, giving the bull an oppor- tunity\n",
      "to step out. For the first time since his capture he did what was wanted; he\n",
      "voluntarily crept to the rear of the wagon and hobbled out on the ground.\n",
      "Looking around for an enemy to attack and not seeing any,âsome of the men\n",
      "having stationed themselves outside the park fence, the others on top of the\n",
      "crate,âhe set out for the river, only a few rods away. âHis courage had not\n",
      "forsaken him, but his strength had. He was no longer the proudly aggressive wild\n",
      "beast he had been. He had reached his limit. The terrible ordeal he had been\n",
      "through; the struggle incident to his capture; the rough, hot ride to the\n",
      "corral, hog-tied, on the hard floor of the dead-ax wagon; the outbursts of\n",
      "passion in the corral; the fighting and second roping in connection with the\n",
      "sawing off of his horns; the battle with the big horse; the ceaseless violence\n",
      "of his de- structive assaults, first in the car, then in the crate, continued\n",
      "for three days and nights, had finally undermined even his iron frame; so when\n",
      "at last he found himself free on the ground, he presented a truly pitiful\n",

      "the other down, and with a dejected, helpless ex- pression on his face, he\n",
      "hobbled wearily away, barely able to step without falling. Slowly he made his\n",
      "way to the river, waded in, drank, crossed to the far side, staggered\n",

      "to fight for his home and country deserves to live and die homeless and without\n",
      "a country. With this subject of courage the parental and fraternal affections of\n",
      "wild animals are inseparably linked. The defense of the home and family unit is\n",
      "the foundation of all courage, and of all fighting qualities in man or animals.\n",
      "The gospel of self- defense is the first plank in the platform of the home\n",
      "defenders. Obviously, the head of a family cannot permit himself to be knocked\n",
      "out, because as the chief fighter in the Home Defense League it is his bounden\n",
      "duty to preserve his strength and his weapons, and remain fit. In the days of\n",
      "the club, the stone axe and the flint arrow- head, men were few and feeble, and\n",
      "the wild beasts had no cause to fear extermination. Tooth, claw and horn were\n",
      "about as formidable as the clumsy and inadequate weapons of man. The wild\n",
      "species went on developing naturally, and some mighty hosts were the result. But\n",
      "gunpowder changed all that. In the chase it gave weak men their innings beside\n",
      "the strong. Man could kill at long range, with little danger to himself, or even\n",
      "with none at all. And then in the wild beast world the great final struggle for\n",
      "existence began. Manâs flippant phrase,ââthe survival of the\n",
      "fittest,ââbecame charged with sinister and deadly meaning. But for Mother\n",

      "location was an error in judgment. As soon as the nest was finished and the eggs\n",
      "laid therein, the goose took her place upon the collection, and the gander\n",
      "mounted guard. There were so many hostiles on the warpath that he was kept on\n",

      "immediately rushed for me. He came straight on, angry and terrible, and charged\n",
      "the wire like a living batter- ing-ram. He repeated these charges until I became\n",

      "to the influence upon the human mind of the great size and terrifying aspect of\n",
      "the animal. Of all the men whom I have known or read, the late R. L. Garner knew\n",
      "by far the most of gorilla habits and character by personal observation in the\n",
      "gorilla jungles of equatorial Africa. And never, in several years of intimate\n",
      "contact with Mr. Garner did he so much as once put forth a statement or an\n",
      "estimate that seemed to me exaggerated or overcolored. In our many discussions\n",
      "of gorilla character Mr. Garner always represented that animal as very shy, wary\n",
      "of observation by man, profoundly cunning in raiding in darkness the banana\n",
      "plantations of manâs villages, and most carefully avoiding exposures by\n",
      "daylight. He described the gorilla as prac- tically never attacking men unless\n",
      "first attacked by them, and fleeing unless forcibly brought to bay. He told me\n",
      "of a re- doubtable African tribesman who once captured a baby gorilla on the\n",
      "ground by suddenly attacking the mother with his club and beating her so\n",
      "successfully that she fled from him and abandoned her young. âBut,â said Mr.\n",
      "Garner, âthere is only one tribe in Africa that could turn out a man who would\n",
      "attempt a feat like that.â That the gorilla can and will fight furiously and\n",
      "effectively when brought to bay is well known, and never denied. Of the apes I\n",
      "have known in captivity, the chimpanzees are by far the most aggressive,\n",
      "courageous and dangerous. A vigorous male specimen over eight years of age is\n",
      "more dan- gerous than a lion, or tiger, or grizzly bear, and far more anxious to\n",
      "fight something. I think that even if our Boma were muzzled, no five men of my\n",

      "he am too brave!â A rogue elephant will attack anything from a wheelbarrow to\n",
      "a hut, and destroy it. The peak of rogue ambition was reached on a railway in\n",
      "Burma, near Ban Klap, in March 1908, when a rogue elephant âon hearing the\n",
      "loco- motive whistle, trumpeted loudly and then, lowering his head, charged the\n",

      "shattered as far as the tubes, the cow-catcher was crushed into a shapeless\n",
      "piece of iron, and other damages of minor importance were sustained. The train\n",
      "was going thirty-four miles per hour, and the engine alone weighed between forty\n",
      "and fifty tons. âOf course the elephant was killed by the shock, its head\n",
      "being completely smashed. . . . It is believed that this par- ticular rogue had\n",
      "been responsible for considerable damage to villages in the vicinity of Lopbusi.\n",
      "A number of houses have been pulled down recently and havoc wrought in other\n",
      "ways.â On another occasion a vicious rogue elephant elected to try conclusions\n",
      "with a railway train. In 1906, on the Korat branch of the Siamese State Railway,\n",
      "a bull elephant attacked a freight train running at full speed. He charged the\n",
      "rushing loco- motive, with the result that the locomotive and several cars were\n",
      "derailed and sent down the side of the grade, and two persons were killed. The\n",
      "elephant was killed outright and buried under the wreck of the train. This\n",
      "occurred in open country, where there was no excuse for an elephant on the\n",
      "track, and therefore the charge of the rogue was wholly gratuitous. Captive\n",
      "elephants whose managers are too humane to punish them for manifestations of\n",
      "meanness become spoiled by their immunity, just as mean children are spoiled\n",
      "when fond and foolish parents feel that their little jackets are too sacred ever\n",
      "to be tanned. Such complete immunity is as bad for bad ele- phants as for bad\n",
      "children, but in practice the severe punish- ment of an elephant with real\n",

      "because she never thrashes it as it deserves, both of her arms from wrist to\n",
      "elbow have been scarified by its teeth. Mr. E. R. Sanborn, official photographer\n",
      "of the Zoological Park, once made an ingenious and also terrifying experiment.\n",
      "He made an excellent dummy keeper, stood it up, and tied it fast against the\n",
      "fence inside the yard of our very large and savage male Grevy Zebra. Then he\n",
      "posed his moving picture camera in a safe place, and the keeper turned the zebra\n",
      "into the yard. The moment the bad zebra caught sight of the presumptive\n",
      "keeper,âat last within his power,âhe rushed at the dummy with glaring eyes\n",

      "the dummy loose from its moorings, whirled it into the middle of the yard, where\n",
      "in a towering rage he knelt upon it, bit and tore its heart out. Of course the\n",
      "unfortunate dummy perished. The zebra reveled in his triumph, and altogether it\n",
      "was a fearsome sight. Caution. A thoroughly cowardly horse never should be\n",
      "ridden, nor driven to anything so light that a runaway is pos- sible. Such\n",
      "animals are too expensive both to human life and to property. A dangerous horse\n",
      "can be just as great a risk as a bad lion or bear. IV.âTHE BASER PASSIONS XXII\n",
      "FEAR AS A RULING PASSION IF we were asked, â Which one may be called the\n",
      "ruling passion of the wild animal? â we would without hesitation answer,âit\n",
      "is fear. From the cradle to the grave, every strictly wild animal lives, day and\n",
      "night, in a state of fear of bodily harm, and dread of hunger and famine. âNow\n",
      "the âfree, wild life* is a round of strife, And of ceaseless hunger and fear;\n",
      "And the life in the wild of the animal child Is not all skittles and beer.â\n",
      "The first thing that the wild baby learns, both by precept and example, is\n",
      "safety first! When the squalling and toddling bear cub first goes abroad, the\n",
      "mother bear is worried and nervous for fear that in a sudden and dangerous\n",
      "emergency the half-helpless little one will not be able to make a successful\n",
      "get-away when the alarm-signal snort is given. During the first, and most\n",
      "dangerous, days in the life of the elk, deer and antelope fawn, the first care\n",
      "of the mother is to hide her off- spring in a spot cunningly chosen beside a\n",
      "rock, beside a log, or in thick bushes. In the absence of all those she looks\n",
      "for a depression in the earth wherein the fawn can lie without making a hump in\n",
      "the landscape. The first impulse of the fawn,â even before nursing if the\n",
      "birth occurs in daylight,âis to fold its long legs, short body and reptilian\n",
      "neck into a very small package, hug the earth tightly, close its eyes and lie\n",
      "absolutely motionless until its mother gives the signal to arise and sup. Such\n",
      "infants may lie for long and weary hours without so much as moving an ear; and\n",
      "the anxious mother strolls away to some distance to avoid disclosing her\n",
      "helpless offspring. Now, suppose you discover and touch an elk or a deer fawn\n",
      "while thus hiding. What will it do? Nine times out of ten it will bound up as if\n",
      "propelled by steel springs, and go off like an arrow from a bow, dashing in any\n",
      "direction that is open and leads straight away. The horrified mother will rush\n",
      "into view in dangerously near proximity, and I have seen a wild white- tailed\n",
      "deer doe tear madly up and down in full view and near by, to attract the danger\n",
      "to herself. Thousands of men and boys have seen a mother quail flop and flutter\n",
      "and play wounded, to lead the dangerous boy away from her brood of little quail\n",
      "mites, and work the ruse so daringly and successfully as to save both her babies\n",
      "and herself. I well remember my surprise and admiration when a mother quail\n",
      "first played that trick upon me. I expected to pick her up,â and forgot all\n",
      "about the chicks,â-until they were every one safely in hiding, and then Mrs.\n",
      "Quail gave me the laugh and flew away. Was it strategy? Was it the result of\n",
      "quail thought and reason? Or did it come by heredity, just like walking? To deny\n",
      "the cold facts in the quail case is to discredit our own ability to reason and\n",
      "be honest. Fear is the ruling emotion alike of the most timid creatures, and\n",
      "also the boldest. Of course each wild animal keeps a mental list of the other\n",
      "animals of which he is not afraid; and the predatory animal also keeps a card\n",
      "catalogue of those which he may safely attack when in need of food. But, with\n",
      "all due consideration to mighty forearm, to deadly claws and stabbing fangs,\n",
      "there is (I think) absolutely no land animal that is not afraid of something.\n",
      "Let us progressively consider a few famous species near at hand. The savage and\n",

      "young female Kadiak bear, may well be cited as an example. The subject was then\n",
      "about two and one-half years old, and was caged in a large open den with four\n",
      "other bears of the same age. Of a European brown bear male, only a trifle larger\n",
      "than herself, she elected to be terror-stricken, as much so as ever a human\n",
      "child was in terror of every move of a brutal adult tormentor. Strangely enough,\n",
      "the cause of all this terror was wholly unconscious of it, and in the course of\n",
      "an observation lasting at least twenty minutes he made not one hostile move-\n",
      "ment. The greater portion of the time he idly moved about in the central space\n",
      "of the den, wholly oblivious of the alarm he was causing. The young Kadiak, in\n",
      "full flesh and vigor, first attracted my attention by her angry and terrified\n",
      "snorting, three quick snorts to the series. On the top of the rocks she raced to\n",
      "and fro, constantly eyeing the bear in the centre of the den. If he moved toward\n",
      "the rocks, she wildly plunged down, snorting and glaring, and raced to the front\n",

      "hostile act and wildly rushed past him and scrambled up the rocks at the farther\n",
      "end of the den. This was repeated about fifteen times in twenty minutes,\n",
      "accompanied by a continuous series of terrified snorts. She panted from\n",

      "between wild animals in a state of nature are almost invariably due to one of\n",
      "two causesâattack and defense in a struggle for prey, or the jealousy of males\n",
      "during the mating season. With rare exceptions, battles of the former class\n",
      "occur between animals of different Orders,âteeth and claws against horns and\n",
      "hoofs, for instance; and it is a fight to the death. Hunger forces the aggressor\n",
      "to attack something, and the intended victim fights because it is attacked. The\n",
      "question of good or ill temper does not enter in. On both sides it is a case of\n",
      "âmust,â and neither party has any option. Such combats are tests of agility,\n",
      "strength, and staying powers, and, in a few cases, of thickness of bone and\n",

      "blood of their own kind through ill temper or jealousy, I have never encountered\n",
      "any more given to inter- necine strife than orang-utans. Their fighting methods,\n",
      "and their love of fighting, are highly suggestive of the temper and actions of\n",
      "the human tough. They fight by biting, and usually it is the fingers and toes\n",
      "that suffer. Of twenty-seven orang- utans I shot in Borneo, and twelve more that\n",
      "were shot for me by native hunters, five were fighters, and had had one or more\n",
      "fingers or toes bitten off in battle. Those specimens were taken in the days\n",
      "when the museums of America were one and all destitute of anthropoid apes. A\n",
      "gorilla, chimpanzee, or orang-utan, being heavy of body, short of neck, and by\n",
      "no means nimble footed, cannot spring upon an adversary, choose a vulnerable\n",
      "spot, and bite to kill; but what it lacks in agility it makes up in length and\n",
      "strength ^73 of arm and hand. It seizes its antagonistâs hand, carries it to\n",
      "its own mouth, and bites at the fingers. Usually, the bitten finger is severed\n",
      "as evenly as by a surgeonâs amputation, and heals quite as successfully. I\n",
      "never saw two big orang-utans fighting, but I have had several captive ones\n",
      "seize my arm and try to bring my fingers within biting distance. The canine\n",
      "teeth of a full grown male orang, standing four feet four inches in height, and\n",
      "weighing a hundred and fifty pounds or more, are just as large and dangerous as\n",
      "the teeth of a bear of the same size, and the powerful incisors have one quality\n",
      "which the teeth of a bear dc not possess. A bear pierces or tears an antagonist\n",
      "with his canines, but very rarely bites off anything. An orang- utan bites off a\n",
      "finger as evenly as a boy nips off the end of a stick of candy. When orang-utans\n",
      "fight, they also attack each otherâs faces, and often their broad and\n",
      "expansive lips suffer severely. My eleventh orang bore the scars of many a\n",
      "fierce duel in the tree-tops. A piece had been bitten out of the middle of both\n",
      "his lips, leaving in each a large, ragged notch. Both his middle fingers had\n",
      "been taken off at the second joint, and his feet had lost the third right toe,\n",
      "the fourth left toe, and the end of one hallux. His back, also, had sustained a\n",
      "severe injury, which had retarded his growth. This animal we called âThe\n",
      "Desperado.â Orang No. 34 had lost the entire edge of his upper lip. It had\n",
      "been bitten across diagonally, but adhered at one corner, and healed without\n",
      "sloughing off, so that during the last years of his life a piece of lip two\n",
      "inches long hung dangling at the corner of his mouth. He had also suffered the\n",
      "loss of an entire finger. No. 36 had lost a good sized piece out of his upper\n",
      "lip, and the first toe had been bitten off his left foot. All these combats must\n",
      "have taken place in the tree-tops, for an adult orang-utan has never been known\n",
      "to descend to the earth except for water. In some manner it has become a\n",
      "prevalent belief that in their native jungles all three of the great\n",
      "apesâgorilla, orang, and chimpanzeeâare dangerous to human beings, and often\n",
      "attack them with clubs. Nothing could be farther from the truth. According to\n",
      "the natives of West Africa, a gorilla or chimpanzee fights a hunter by biting\n",
      "his face and fingers, just as an orang-utan does. I believe that no sane orang\n",
      "ever voluntarily left the safety of a tree top to fight at a serious\n",
      "disadvantage on the ground; and I am sure an orang never struck a blow with a\n",
      "club, unless carefully taught to do so. Wild Animals Are Not Quarrelsome. As a\n",
      "species, man appears to be the most quarrelsome animal on the earth; and the\n",
      "same quality is strongly reflected in his most impres- sionable servant and\n",
      "companion, the domestic dog. Nearly all species of wild animals have learned the\n",
      "two foundation facts of the philosophy of lifeâthat peace is better than war,\n",
      "and that if one must fight, it is better to fight outside oneâs own species.\n",
      "To this rule, however, wolves are a notable exception; for wherever wolves are\n",
      "abundant a wounded wolf is a subject for attack, and usually it is killed and\n",
      "eaten by the other members of the pack. I have observed the daily habits of many\n",
      "kinds of wild animals in their wild haunts, but in the field I never yet have\n",
      "seen either a fight between animals of the same species, or be- tween two of\n",
      "different species. This may seem a very humi- liating admission for a hunter to\n",
      "make, but it happens to be true. In the matter of finding big snakes, having\n",
      "exciting adventures, and witnessing combats between wild animals, there are some\n",
      "men who never are in luck. Now there was the âOld Shekarry,ââwhose\n",
      "elephants, tigers, bison, bears, and sambar always were so much larger than\n",
      "mine. In his book, âSport in Many Lands,â he describes an affair of honor\n",
      "between a tiger and a bull bison, which was a truly ideal combat. The champions\n",
      "met by appointment,â by the light of the moon, in order to be safe from\n",
      "interference by the jungle police,â-and they fought round after round, in the\n",
      "most orthodox prize ring style, under the Queensberry rules. So fairly did they\n",
      "fight that neither claimed a foul, and at the finish the two combatants retired\n",
      "to their respective corners and died simultaneously, âto the musical twitter\n",
      "of the night bird.â Another writer has given a vivid description of a battle\n",
      "to the death between a wild bull and a grizzly bear; and we have read of several\n",
      "awful combats between black bears and alli- gators, in Florida; but some of us\n",

      "between wild bears. He once saw a battle between a cinnamon and a grizzly over\n",
      "the carcass of an elk. In attacking, a bear does three things, and usually in\n",
      "the same order. First, he delivers a sweeping sidewise blow on the head of his\n",
      "antagonist; then he seizes him by the cheek, with the intention of shifting to\n",
      "the throat as quickly as it is safe to do so. His third move consists in\n",

      "struggle is head to head and mouth to mouth. After the first onset, the paws do\n",
      "little or no damage, and the attacks of the teeth rarely go as far down as the\n",

      "purely defensive, and often is maintained until an opportunity occurs to attack\n",

      "frequent occurrence* but in a wild state they rarely end in bloodshed or death,\n",
      "save from locked antlers. Many times, however, two bucks will come together, and\n",
      "playfully push each other about without being angry. Many pairs of bucks have\n",
      "been found with their antlers fast locked in deathâand I never see a death\n",
      "lock without a feeling of grim satisfaction that neither of the quarrelsome\n",
      "brutes had had an opportunity to attack some defenseless man, and spear him to\n",

      "And whenever this hap- pens, the doom of both deer is sealed. Unless found\n",
      "speedily and killed, they must die of starvation. While it is quite true that\n",
      "two deer playing with their antlers may become locked fast, it is safe to say\n",
      "that the great majority meet their fate by charging each other with force\n",
      "sufficient to spring the beams of their antlers, and make the lock so perfect\n",
      "that no force they can exert will release it. A deer cannot pull back with the\n",
      "same power it exerts in plunging forward. All members of the deer family that I\n",
      "know follow the same natural law in regard to supremacy. Indeed, this is true of\n",
      "nearly all animals. Leadership is not always maintained by the largest and\n",
      "strongest member of a herd,, but very often by the most pugnacious. Sometimes a\n",

      "soon as he feels that he is mastered he releases his antlers at the first\n",

      "fight head to head, there are no casualties; but when one wearies and weakens\n",
      "before the other, its guard is broken. Then one strong thrust in its side or\n",

      "cow elkâMay Queen and the Dowager. A bunch of black fungus suddenly appeared\n",
      "on the trunk of a tree, about twelve feet from the ground. My attention was\n",
      "first called to this by seeing May Queen, a fine young cow, standing erect on\n",
      "her hind legs in order to reach the tempting morsel with her mouth. A little\n",
      "later the Dowager, the oldest and largest cow elk in the herd, met her under the\n",
      "tree, whereupon the two made wry faces at each other, and champed their teeth\n",
      "together threateningly. Suddenly both cows rose on their hind legs, struck out\n",
      "viciously with their sharp pointed front hoofs, and, after a lively sparring\n",
      "bout, they actually clinched. The young cow got both front legs of the old cow\n",
      "between her own, where they were held practically helpless, and then with her\n",
      "own front hoofs she fiercely rained blows upon the ribs of her assailant. The\n",
      "Dowager backed away and fled, completely vanquished, with May Queen close upon\n",
      "her heels; and thus was the tyrannical rule of the senior cow overthrown\n",
      "forever. During the breeding season, our wild buffaloes of the great vanished\n",

      "Hauraki Gulf, between Ponui Island and Coromandel, as reported in the\n",
      "âAuckland Weekly News,â 19th Nov., 1908. A cow whale and her calf were\n",
      "attacked by a 12 ft. 6 in. swordfish, the object of the fish being the calf. The\n",
      "whale plunged about and struck in all directions with her flukes. Occasionally\n",
      "the fins of the swordfish were seen as he rose from a dive, his object\n",
      "apparently being to strike from below. For over a quarter of an hour the whale\n",
      "circled round her calf, lashing furiously and churning up the water so that the\n",
      "assailant was unable to secure a good oppor- tunity for a thrust. At last, after\n",
      "a fruitless dive, the swordfish came close up and made a thrust at the calf, but\n",
      "received a blow from the whaleâs flukes across the back, which apparently\n",
      "paralyzed it. It was killed and hauled on board the boat without difficulty,\n",
      "while the whale and calf went off towards Coromandel with splashings and\n",
      "plungings. The whaleâs blow had almost knocked off the back fin of the\n",
      "swordfish, and heavily bruised the flesh around it. No threshers accompanied the\n",

      "CRIME MANY human beings are âgoodâ because they never have been under the\n",
      "harrow of circumstances, nor sufficiently tempted to do wrong. It is only under\n",
      "the strain of strong temptation that human character is put through the\n",
      "thirty-third degree and tried out. No doubt a great many of us could be provoked\n",
      "to join a mob for murder, or forced to steal, or tortured into homicidal\n",
      "insanity. It is only under the artificial conditions of captivity, with loss of\n",
      "freedom, exemption from the daily fear of death, abundant food without\n",
      "compensating labor, and with every want supplied, that the latent wickedness of\n",
      "wild creatures comes to the surface. A captive animal often reveals traits never\n",
      "recognized in the free individual. âSatan finds some mischief still for idle\n",
      "hands to do.â These manifestations are of many kinds; but we propose to\n",
      "consider the criminal tendencies of wild animals both free and captive. The\n",
      "persistence of the mental and moral parallelism between men and wild animals is\n",
      "a source of constant surprise. In a state of freedom, untrammeled by anything\n",
      "save the fear of death by violence, the deer or the mountain sheep works out in\n",
      "his own way his chosen scheme for the survival of the fittest,âhimself. In the\n",
      "wilds we see very few manifestations of the criminal instinct. A fight between\n",
      "wild elk bulls for the supremacy of a herd is not a manifestation of murder\n",
      "lust, but of obedience to the fundamental law of evolution that the the largest,\n",
      "the strongest and the most courageous males of every herd shall do the breeding.\n",
      "The killing of natural prey for daily food is not murder. A starving wolf on the\n",
      "desolate barren grounds may even kill and devour a wounded pack-mate without\n",
      "becoming a criminal by that act alone. True, such a manifestation of\n",
      "hard-hearted- ness and bad taste is very reprehensible; but its cause is hunger,\n",
      "not sheer blackness of heart. Among wild animals, the wanton killing of a member\n",
      "of the killerâs own species would constitute murder in the first degree, and\n",
      "so is all unnecessary and wanton killing outside the killerâs own species. To\n",
      "many a wild animal there comes at times the murder lust which under the spur of\n",
      "opportunity leads to genuine crime. In some of the many cases that have come\n",
      "under my notice, the desire to commit murder for the sake of murder has been as\n",
      "sharply defined as the fangs or horns of the crim- inal. Of the many emotions of\n",
      "wild animals which are revealed more sharply in captivity than in a state of\n",
      "nature, the crime- producing passions, of jealousy, hatred, desire for revenge,\n",
      "and devilish lust for innocent blood, are most prominent. In the management of\n",
      "large animals in captivity, the criminal instinct is quite as great a\n",
      "trouble-breeder and source of anxiety as are wild-animal diseases, and the\n",
      "constant struggle with the elements. In many cases there is not the slightest\n",
      "premonitory mani- festation of murderous intent on the part of a potential crim-\n",
      "inal. Indeed, with most cunning wisdom, a wild-animal murderer will often\n",
      "conceal his purpose until outside inter- ference is an impossibility, and the\n",
      "victim is entirely helpless. These manifestations of fiendish cunning and\n",
      "premeditation are very exasperating to those responsible for the care of animals\n",
      "in captivity. In every well regulated zoological park, solitary confine- ment is\n",
      "regarded as an unhappy or intolerable condition. Animals that live in herds and\n",
      "groups in large enclosures always exercise more, have better appetites, and are\n",
      "much more contented and happy than individuals that are singly confined. To\n",
      "visitors, a happy and contented community of deer, ante- lopes, bears, wolves,\n",
      "or birds is a source of far more mental satisfaction than could be found in any\n",
      "number of solitary animals. A small pen with a solitary animal in it at once\n",
      "suggests the prison-and-prisoner idea, and sometimes arouses pity and compassion\n",
      "rather than pleased admiration. The peaceful herd or flock is the thing to\n",
      "strive for as the highest ideal attainable in an exhibition of wild animals. But\n",
      "mark well the difficulties. All the obstacles encountered in carrying out the\n",
      "community idea are created by the evil propensities of the animals themselves.\n",
      "Among the hoofed animals generally, every pair of horns and front hoofs is a\n",
      "possible storm-center. No keeper knows whether the members of his herd of deer\n",
      "will live together in peace and contentment until tomorrow, or whether, on any\n",
      "autumn or winter night, a buck will suddenly develop in his antlered head the\n",
      "thought that it is a good time to âkill something.â In the pairing season we\n",
      "always watch for trouble, and the danger signal always is up. In October a male\n",
      "elk may become ever so savage, and finally develop into a raging demon,\n",
      "dangerous to man and beast; but when he first manifests his new temper openly\n",
      "and in the broad light of day, we feel that he is treating fairly both his\n",
      "herd-mates and his keepers. If he gives fair warning to the world about him, we\n",
      "must not class him as a mean criminal, no matter what he may do later on. It is\n",
      "our duty to corral him at night according to the violence of his rage. If we\n",
      "separate him from the herd, and he tears a fence in pieces and kills his rival,\n",
      "that is honest, open warfare, not foul murder. But take the following case. In\n",
      "October, 1905, the New York Zoological Park received from the state of\n",
      "Washington a young mule deer buck and two does. Being conspicuous members of the\n",
      "worst species of âdifficultâ deer to keep alive at Atlantic tidewater, and\n",
      "being also very thin and weak, it required the combined efforts of several\n",
      "persons to keep them alive. For six months they moped about their corral, but at\n",
      "last they began to improve. The oldest doe gave birth to two fawns which\n",
      "actually survived. But, even when the next mating season began, the buck con-\n",
      "tinued to be lanquid and blase. At no time did he exhibit signs of temper, of\n",
      "even suspicious vigor. In the middle of the night of November 6, 1906, without\n",
      "the slightest warning, he decided to commit a murder, and the mother of the two\n",
      "nursing fawns was selected as the victim. Being weak from the rearing of her\n",
      "offspring, she was at his mercy. He gored her most savagely, about twenty times,\n",
      "and killed her. That was deliberate, fiendish and cowardly murder. The killing\n",
      "of any female animal by her male consort is murder; but there are circumstances\n",
      "wherein the plea of temporary insanity is an admissible defense. In the autumn,\n",
      "male mem- bers of the deer family often become temporarily insane and\n",
      "irresponsible, and should be judged accordingly. With us, sexual insanity is a\n",
      "recognized disease. Such distressing cases as the above are so common that\n",
      "whenever I go deer-hunting and kill a lusty buck, the thought occurs to\n",
      "me,ââanother undeveloped murderer, perhaps!â The most exasperating thing\n",
      "about these corral murders is the cunning treachery of the murderers. Here is\n",
      "another typical case: For three years a dainty little male Osceola deer from\n",
      "Florida was as gentle as a fawn and as harmless as a dove. But one crisp morning\n",
      "Keeper Quinn, to whom every doe in his charge is like a foster-daughter, was\n",
      "horrified at finding blood on the absurd little antlers of the Osceola pet. One\n",
      "of the females lay dead in a dark corner where she had been murdered during the\n",
      "night; and this with another and older buck in the same corral which might\n",
      "fairly have been regarded as an offensive rival. The desire to murder for the\n",
      "sake of killing is born in some carnivorous animals, and by others it is\n",
      "achieved. Among the largest and finest of the felines, the lions and tigers,\n",
      "mid- night murders very rarely occur. We never have known one. Individual\n",
      "dislike is shown boldly and openly, and we are given a fair chance to prevent\n",
      "fatalities. Among the lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars and pumas of the New York\n",
      "Zoological Park, there has been but one murder. That was the crime of Lopez, the\n",
      "big jaguar, who richly deserved instant death as a punishment. It was one of the\n",
      "most cunning crimes I have ever seen among wild animals, and is now historic.\n",
      "For a year Lopez pretended, ostentatiously, to be a good- natured animal! Twenty\n",
      "times at least he acted the part of a playful pet, inviting me to reach in and\n",
      "stroke him. At last we decided to give him a cage-mate, and a fine adult female\n",
      "jaguar was purchased. The animals actually tried to caress each other through\n",
      "the bars, and the big male completely deceived us, one and all. At the end of\n",
      "two days it was considered safe to permit the female jaguar to enter the cage of\n",
      "Lopez. She was just as much deceived as we were. An animal that is afraid always\n",
      "leaves its traveling-cage slowly and unwillingly, or refuses to leave it at all.\n",
      "When the two sets of doors were opened, the female joyously walked into the cage\n",
      "of her treacherous admirer. In an instant, Lopez rushed upon her, seized her\n",
      "whole neck in his powerful jaws, and crushed her cervical vertebrae by his awful\n",
      "bite. We beat him over the head; we spiked him; we even tried to brain him; but\n",
      "he held her, as a bull-dog would hold a cat, until she was dead. He had\n",
      "determined to murder her, but had cunningly concealed his purpose until his\n",
      "victim was fully in his power. Bears usually fight âon the square,â openly\n",
      "and above- board, rarely committing foul murder. If one bear hates another, he\n",
      "attacks at the very first opportunity, He does not cunningly wait to catch the\n",
      "offender at a disadvantage and beyond the possibility of rescue. Sometimes a\n",
      "captive bear kills a cage-mate or mauls a keeper, but not by the sneak- ing\n",
      "methods of the human assassin who shoots in the dark and runs away. I do not\n",
      "count the bear as a common criminal, even though at rare intervals he kills a\n",
      "cage-mate smaller and weaker than himself. One killing of that kind, done by\n",
      "Cinnamon Jim to a small black bear that had annoyed him beyond all endurance,\n",
      "was inflicted as a legitimate punishment, and was so recorded. The attack of two\n",
      "large bears, a Syrian and a sloth bear, upon a small Japanese black bear, in\n",
      "which the big pair deliberately attempted to disembowel the small victim, biting\n",
      "him only in the abdomen, always has been a puzzle to me. I cannot fathom the\n",
      "idea which possessed those two ursine minds; but I have no doubt that some of\n",
      "the book-making men who read the minds of wild animals as if they were open\n",
      "books could tell me all about it. On the ice-pack in front of his stone hut at\n",
      "the north end of the Franz Josef Archipelago Nansen saw an occurrence that was\n",
      "plain murder. A large male polar bear feeding upon a dead walrus was approached\n",
      "across the ice-pack by two polar- bear cubs. The gorging male immediately\n",
      "stopped feeding and rushed toward the small intruders. They turned and fled\n",
      "wdldly; but the villain pursued them, far out upon the ice. He overtook them,\n",
      "killed both, and then serenely re- turned to his solitary feast. In February,\n",
      "1907, a tragedy occurred in the Zoological Park which was a close parallel of\n",
      "the Lopez murder. It was a case in which my only crumb of satisfaction was in my\n",
      "ability to say, âI told you so,â-â-than which no consolation can be more\n",
      "barren. For seven years there had lived together in the great polar bearsâ den\n",
      "of the Zoological Park two full-grown, very large and fine polar bears. They\n",
      "came from William Hagen- beckâs great group, and both were males. Their\n",
      "rough-and- tumble wrestling, both in the swimming pool and out of it, was a\n",
      "sight of almost perennial interest; and while their biting and boxing was of the\n",
      "roughest character, and frequently drew blood, they never got angry, and never\n",
      "had a real fight. In the autumn of 1906 one of the animals sickened and died,\n",
      "and presently the impression prevailed that the survivor was lonesome. The\n",
      "desirability of introducing a female com- panion was spoken of, but I was afraid\n",
      "to try the experiment. By and by, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, who had handled about\n",
      "forty polar bears to my one, wrote to us, offering a fine female polar as a mate\n",
      "to the survivor. She was conceded to be one- third smaller than the big male,\n",
      "but was fully adult. Without loss of time I answered, declining to make the\n",
      "purchase, on the ground that our male bear would kill the female. It was my\n",
      "belief that even if he did not at once deliberately murder her, he soon would\n",
      "wear her out by his rough play. Mr. Hagenbeck replied with the assurance that,\n",
      "in his opinion, all would be well; that, instead of a tragedy taking place, the\n",
      "male would be delighted with a female companion, and that the pair would breed.\n",
      "As convincing proof of the sincerity of his views, Mr. Hagenbeck offered to lose\n",
      "half the purchase price of the female bear in the event that my worst fears were\n",
      "realized. I asked the opinion of our head keeper of bears, and after due\n",
      "reflection he said: âWhy, no; I donât believe heâd kill her. Heâs not a\n",
      "bad bear at all. I think we could work it so that there would be no great\n",
      "trouble.â Mr. Hagenbeckâs son also felt sure there would be no tragedy.\n",
      "Quite against my own judgment of polar-bear character, but in deference to the\n",
      "expert opinion arrayed against mine, I finally yielded. The female bear was\n",
      "purchased, and on her arrival she was placed for three weeks in the large\n",
      "shifting- cage which connects with the eastern side of the great polar bearsâ\n",
      "den. The two animals seemed glad to see each other. At once they fraternized\n",
      "through the bars, licked each otherâs noses, and ate their meals side by side.\n",
      "At night the male always slept as near as possible to his new companion. There\n",
      "was not a sign of ill temper; but, for all that, my doubts were ever present. At\n",
      "last, after three full weeks of close acquaintance, it was agreed that there was\n",
      "nothing to be gained by longer delay in admitting the female to the large den.\n",
      "But we made preparations for trouble. The door of the sleeping-den was oiled and\n",
      "overhauled and put in thorough working order, so that if the female should dash\n",
      "into it for safety, a keeper could instantly slide the barrier and shut her in.\n",
      "We provided pike-poles, long iron bars, lariats, meat, and long planks a foot\n",
      "wide. Heartily wishing myself a hundred miles away, I summoned all my courage\n",
      "and gave the order: âOpen her door, a foot only, and let her put her head out.\n",
      "Keep him away.â The female bear had not the slightest fear or premonition of\n",
      "danger. Thrusting her head through the narrow opening, she looked upon the world\n",
      "and the open sky above, and found that it was good. She struggled to force the\n",
      "door open wider; and the male stood back, waiting. âLet her go!â Forcing the\n",
      "door back with her own eager strength, she fearlessly dropped the intervening\n",
      "eighteen inches to the floor of the den, and was free. The very next second the\n",
      "male flung his great bulk upon her, and the tragedy was on. I would not for five\n",
      "thousand dollars see such a thing again. A hundred times in the twenty minutes\n",
      "that followed I bitterly regretted my folly in acting contrary to my own\n",
      "carefully formed conclusions regarding the temper, the strength, and the mental\n",
      "processes of that male bear. He never left her alone for ten seconds, save when,\n",
      "at five or six different times, we beat him off by literally ramming him away.\n",
      "When she first fell, the slope of the floor brought a94 her near the cage bars,\n",
      "which gave us a chance to fight for her. We beat him over the head; we drove big\n",
      "steel spikes into him; and we rammed him with planks, not caring how many bones\n",
      "we might break. But each time that we beat him off, and the poor harried female\n",
      "rose to her feet, he flung himself upon her anew, crushed her down upon the\n",
      "snow, and fought to reach her throat! Gallantly the female fought for her life,\n",
      "with six wild men to help her. After a long battle,âit seemed like hours, but\n",
      "I suppose it was between twenty and thirty minutes, the male bear recognized the\n",
      "fact that so long as the female lay near the bars his own punishment would\n",
      "continue and the end would be postponed. Forthwith he seized his victim and\n",
      "dragged her inward and down to the ice that covered the swimming-pool in the\n",
      "centre of the den, beyond our reach. The floor of the den was so slippery from\n",
      "ice and snow that it was utterly unsafe for any of our men to enter and try to\n",
      "approach the now furious animal within striking distance. Very quickly some\n",
      "choice pieces of fresh meat were thrown within six feet of the bears, in the\n",
      "hope that the male would be tempted away from his victim. In vain! Then, with\n",
      "all possible haste, Keeper Mulvehill coiled a lasso, bravely entered the den,\n",
      "and with the first throw landed the noose neatly around the neck of the male\n",
      "bear. In a second it was jerked taut, the end passed through the bars, and ten\n",
      "eager arms dragged the big bear away from his victim and close up to the bars.\n",
      "Another lariat was put on him to guard against break- ages, and no bear ever\n",
      "missed being choked to death by a narrower margin than did that one. That morsel\n",
      "of revenge was sweet. While he was held thus, two men went in and attached a\n",
      "rope to the now dying female, and she was quickly dragged into the\n",
      "shifting-cage. But the rescue came too late. At the last moment on the ice, the\n",
      "canine teeth of the big bear had severed the jugular vein of the female, and in\n",
      "two minutes after her rescue she was dead. It is my belief that at first the\n",
      "male did not intend to murder the female, I think his first impulse was to play\n",
      "with her, as he had always done with the male comrade of his own size. But\n",
      "thejoy of combat seized him, and after that his only purpose was to kill. My\n",
      "verdict was, not premeditated murder, but murder in the second degree. In the\n",
      "order of carnivorous animals, I think the worst criminals are found in the\n",
      "Marten Family (.Mustelidae); and if there is a more murderous villain than the\n",
      "mink, I have yet to find him out. The mink is a midnight assassin, who loves\n",
      "slaughter for the joy of murder. The wolverine, the marten, mink and weasel are\n",
      "all courageous, savage and merci- less. To the wolverine Western trappers accord\n",
      "the evil distinction of being a veritable imp of darkness on four legs. To them\n",
      "he is the arch-fiend, beyond which animal cunning and depravity cannot go.\n",
      "Excepting the profane history of the pickings and stealings of this âmountain\n",
      "devilâ as recorded by suffering trappers, I know little of it; but if its\n",
      "instincts are not supremely murderous, its reputation is no index of its\n",
      "character. The mink, however, is a creature that we know and fear. Along the\n",
      "rocky shores of the Bronx River, even in the Zoo- logical Park, it perversely\n",
      "persisted long after our park- building began. In spite of traps, guns, and\n",
      "poison, and the killing of from three to five annually in our Park, Putorius\n",
      "vison would not give up. With us, the only creatures that practiced wholesale\n",
      "and unnecessary murder were minks and dogs. The former killed our birds, and\n",
      "during one awful period when a certain fence was being rebuilt, the latter\n",
      "destroyed several deer. A mink once visited an open-air yard containing\n",
      "twenty-two pinioned laughing gulls, and during that noche triste killed all of\n",
      "those ill-fated birds. It did not devour even one, and it sucked the blood of\n",
      "only two or three. On another tragic occasion a mink slaughtered an entire flock\n",
      "of fifteen gulls; but its joy of killing was short-lived, for it was quickly\n",
      "caught and clubbed to death. A miserable little weasel killed three fine brant\n",
      "geese, purely for the love of murder; and then he departed this life by the\n",
      "powder-and-lead route. All the year round captive buffalo bulls are given to\n",
      "fighting, and for one bull to injure or kill another is an occurrence all too\n",
      "common. Even in the great twenty-seven thousand acre reserve of the Corbin Blue\n",
      "Mountain Forest Association, fatal fights sometimes occur. It was left to a\n",
      "large bull named Black Beauty, in our Zoological Park herd, to reveal the\n",
      "disagreeable fact that under certain circumstances a buffalo may become a\n",
      "cunning and deliberate assassin. In the spring of 1904, a new buffalo bull,\n",
      "named Apache, was added to the portion of our herd which up to that time had\n",
      "been dominated by Black Beauty. We expected the usual head-to-head battle for\n",
      "supremacy, succeeded by a period of peace and quiet. It is the law of the herd\n",
      "that after every contest for supremacy the vanquished bull shall accept the\n",
      "situation philosophically, and thereafter keep his place. At the end of a\n",
      "half-hour of fierce struggle, head-to-head, Black Beauty was overpowered by\n",
      "Apache, and fled from him into the open range. To emphasize his victory, Apache\n",
      "fol- lowed him around and around at a quiet walk, for several hours; but the\n",
      "beaten bull always kept a factor of safety of about two hundred feet between\n",
      "himself and the master of the herd. Convinced that Black Beauty would no longer\n",
      "dispute his supremacy, Apache at last pronounced for peace and thought no more\n",
      "about the late unpleasantness. His rival seemed to accept the situation, and\n",
      "rejoined the herd on the subdued status of an ex-president. For several days\n",
      "nothing occurred; but all the while Black Beauty was biding his time and\n",
      "watching for an opportunity. At last it came. As Apache lay dozing and\n",
      "ruminating on a sunny hill-side, his beaten rival quietly drifted around his\n",
      "resting-place, stealthily secured a good position, and, without a secondâs\n",
      "warning plunged his sharp horns deep into the lungs of the reclining bull. With\n",
      "the mad energy of pent-up and superheated fury, the assassin delivered stab\n",
      "after stab into the unprotected side of the helpless victim, and before Apache\n",
      "could gain his feet he had been gored many times. He lived only a few minutes.\n",
      "It was foul murder, fully premeditated; and had Black Beauty been my personal\n",
      "property, he would have been executed for the crime, without any objections, or\n",
      "motions, or appeals, or far-fetched certificates of unreasonable doubt. During\n",
      "the past twenty years a number of persons have been treacherously murdered by\n",
      "animals they had fed and protected. One of the most deplorable of these\n",
      "tragedies occurred late in 1906, near Montclair, New Jersey. Mr. Herbert Bradley\n",
      "was the victim. While walking through his deer park, he was wantonly attacked by\n",
      "a white-tailed buck and murdered on the spot. At Helena, Montana, a strong man\n",
      "armed with a pitchfork was killed by a bull elk. There have been several other\n",
      "fatalities from elk. The greater number of such crimes as the above have been\n",
      "committed by members of the Deer Family (deer, elk, moose and caribou). The\n",
      "hollow-homed ruminants seem to be different. I believe that toward their keepers\n",
      "the bison, buffaloes and wild cattle entertain a certain measure of respect that\n",
      "in members of the Deer Family often is totally absent. But there are exceptions;\n",
      "and a very sad and notable case was the murder of Richard W. Rock, of Henryâs\n",
      "Lake, Idaho, in 1903. Dick Rock was a stalwart ranchman in the prime of life,\n",
      "who possessed a great fondness for big-game animals. He lived not far from the\n",
      "western boundry of the Yellowstone Park. He liked to rope elk and moose in\n",
      "winter, and haul them on sleds to his ranch; to catch mountain goats or mule\n",
      "deer for exhibition; and to breed buffaloes. His finest bull buffalo, named\n",
      "Indian, was one of his favorites, and was broken to ride! Scores of times Rock\n",
      "rode him around the corral, barebacked and without bridle or halter. Rock felt\n",
      "that he could confidently trust the animal, and he never dreamed of guarding\n",
      "himself against a possible evil day. But one day the blood lust seized the\n",
      "buffalo, and he decided to assassinate his best friend. The next time Dick Rock\n",
      "entered the corral, closing the gate and fastening it securely,âthus shutting\n",
      "himself in,âthe big bull attacked him so suddenly and fiercely that there was\n",
      "not a moment for either escape or rescue. We can easily estimate the sudden-\n",
      "ness of the attack by the fact that alert and active Dick Rock had not time even\n",
      "to climb upon the fence of the corral, where- by his life would have been saved.\n",
      "With a mighty upward thrust, the treacherous bull drove one of his horns deeply\n",
      "into his masterâs body, and impaled him so completely and so securely that the\n",
      "man hung there and died there! As a crowning horror, the bull was unable to\n",
      "dislodge his victim, and the body of the ranchman was carried about the corral\n",
      "on the horns of his assassin until the horrified wife went a mile and a half and\n",
      "summoned a neighbor, who brought a rifle and executed the murderer on the spot.\n",
      "Such sudden onslaughts as this make it unsafe to trust implicitly, and without\n",

      "open: Alaskan brown bears, the grizzly bears, lion, tiger, elephant, leopard,\n",
      "wolf, African buffalo, Indian gaur and buffalo, and gorilla. All these species\n",
      "are dangerous to the man who meddles with them, either to kill or to capture\n",
      "them. If they are not molested by man, there is very little to fear from any of\n",
      "them save the man-eating lions and tigers, the northern wolf packs, Alaskan\n",
      "brown bears and rogue elephants. 2. In captivity, or in process of capture:\n",
      "Under this head a special list may be thus composed: Male elk and deer in the\n",
      "rutting season; male elephants over fifteen years of age; all bears over one\n",
      "year of age, and especially âpetâ bears; all gorillas, chimpanzees and\n",
      "orangs over seven years of age (puberty); all adult male baboons, gibbons,\n",
      "rhesus monkeys, callithrix or green monkeys, Japanese red- faced monkeys and\n",
      "large macaques; many adult bison bulls and cows of individually bad temper; also\n",
      "gaur, Old World buffalo, anoa bulls, many individually bad African antelopes,\n",

      "all male zebras and wild asses over four years of age. How they attack. The\n",
      "lion, tiger and bear launches at a manâs head or face a lightning-quick and\n",
      "powerful fore-paw blow that in one stroke tears the skin and flesh in long\n",
      "gashes, and knocks down the victim with stunning force. Before recovery is\n",
      "possible the assailant rushes to the prostrate man and begins to bite or to tear\n",
      "him. Instinctively the fallen man covers his face with his arms, and with the\n",
      "lion, tiger and leopard, the arms come in for fearful punishment. It is the way\n",
      "of carnivorous beasts to attack each other head to head and mouth to mouth, and\n",
      "this same instinct leads these animals to focus their initial attacks upon the\n",
      "heads and faces of their human quarry. After a man-eating lion or tiger has\n",
      "reduced the human 3Â° 4 victim to a state of non-resistance, the great beast\n",
      "seizes the man by a bite embracing the chest, and with the feet dragging upon\n",
      "the ground rushes off to a place of safety to devour him at leisure. Dr. David\n",
      "Livingston was seized alive by a lion, and carried I forget how many yards\n",
      "without a stop. His left humerus was broken in the onset, but the lion abandoned\n",
      "him without doing him any further serious harm. Once I could not believe that a\n",
      "lion or a tiger could pick up a man in his mouth and rapidly carry him off, as a\n",

      "standing 37 inches high and measuring 35 inches around his jaws, I was forever\n",

      "stockade seven feet high, seized a Chinese woodcutter, leaped out with him, and\n",
      "carried him away. In a scrimmage with a lion or tiger in the open, the fight is\n",
      "not prolonged. It is a case of kill or be killed quickly. The time of times for\n",
      "steady nerves and perfectly accurate shooting is when a lion, tiger or bear\n",
      "charges the hunter at full speed, beginning sufficiently far away to give the\n",
      "hunter a sporting chance. The hunter can not afford to be âscaredlâ It is\n",
      "liable to cost too much! The Alaskan brown bear has a peculiar habit.\n",
      "Occasionally he kills the hunter he has struck down, but very often he con-\n",

      "Such unfortunates lie upon their faces, with their arms protecting their heads\n",
      "as best they can, and take the awful punishment until the bear tires of it and\n",

      "very rarely attack men in the wilds, unless they have been wounded and brought\n",
      "to bay; and then very naturally they fight furiously. It is the attacks of\n",
      "captive or park-bred animals that are most to be feared. All the deer that I\n",
      "know attack in the same way,âfirst by a slow push forward, in order to come to\n",
      "close quarters without getting hurt, and then follows the relentless push, push,\n",
      "push to get up steam for the final raging and death-dealing drive. Even in\n",
      "fighting each other, buck elk and deer do not come together with a long run and\n",
      "a grand crash. Each potential fighter fears for his own eyes, and conserves them\n",
      "by a cautious and deliberate engaging process. This is referred to in another\n",
      "chapter. Fortunately for poor humanity, the same slow and cautious tactics are\n",
      "adopted when a buck deer or wapiti decides to attack a man. This gives the man\n",
      "in the case a chance to put up his defense. The attacking deer lowers his head,\n",
      "throws his antlers far to the front, and pushes for the body of the man. The\n",
      "instant a tine touches the soft breast or abdomen, he lunges forward to drive it\n",
      "in. But thanks to that life-saving slow start, the man is mercifully afforded a\n",
      "few seconds of time in which to save himself, or at least delay the punishment.\n",
      "No man ever should enter the enclosure of a âbadâ deer, or any buck deer in\n",
      "the rut, without a stout and tough club or pitchfork for defense. Of the two\n",
      "weapons, the former is the best. In the first place, keep away from all bad\n",
      "deer, especially between October and January first. If you are beset, follow\n",
      "these instructions, as you value your life: If unarmed, seize the deer by the\n",
      "antlers before he touches your vitals, hold on for all you are worth, and shout\n",
      "for help. Keep your feet, just as long as you possibly can. Never mind being\n",
      "threshed about, so long as you keep your feet and keep the tines out of your\n",
      "vitals. Your three hopes are (i) that help will come, (2) or that you can come\n",
      "within reach of a club or some shelter, or (3) that the animal will in some\n",
      "manner decide to desist,âa most forlorn hope. With a good club, or even a\n",
      "stout walking-stick, you have a fighting chance. As the animal lowers his head\n",
      "and comes close up to impale you on his spears of bone, hit him a smashing blow\n",
      "across the side of his head, or his nose. In a desperate sit- uation, aim at the\n",
      "eye, and lay on the blows. If your life is in danger from a buck elk or a large\n",
      "deer, do not hesitate about putting out an eye for him. What are a thousand deer\n",
      "eyes compared with a twelve inch horn thrust through your stomach? My standing\n",
      "instructions to our keepers of dangerous animals are: â Save your own life, at\n",
      "all hazards. Donât let a dangerous animal kill you. Kill any animal rather\n",
      "than let it kill you!â It is useless to strike a charging deer on the top of\n",
      "its head, or on its antlers. Give a sweeping side blow for the unprotected cheek\n",
      "and jaw, or the tender nose. There is nothing that a club can do that is so\n",
      "disconcerting as the eye and nose attack, for a badly injured eye always shuts\n",
      "both eyes, automatically. Once when alone in the corral of the axis deer herd, I\n",
      "was treacherously and wantonly attacked by a full-grown buck. I had violated my\n",
      "own rules about going in armed with a stick, and it was lucky for me that the\n",
      "axis deer was not as large as the barasingha or the mule deer. As the buck\n",
      "lowered his head, threw his long, sharp beams straight forward, and pushed for\n",
      "my vitals, I seized him by both antlers, to make my defense. At that he drove\n",
      "forward and nearly upset me. Quickly I let go the right antler and shifted\n",
      "myself to the animalâs left side, where by means of the left antler I pulled\n",
      "the struggling buckâs head around to my side. Then he began to plunge.\n",
      "Throwing the weight of my chest upon his shoulders I reached over him and with\n",
      "my free hand finally grasped his right foreleg below the knee, and pulled it up\n",
      "clear of the ground. With that I had him. He tried to struggle free, but I was\n",
      "strong in those days, and angry besides, and he was helpless. Up beside the deer\n",
      "barn, most providentially for the finish, I saw a very beautiful barrel stave.\n",
      "It was the very thing! I worked him over to it, caught it up, and then still\n",
      "holding him by his left antler I laid that stave along his side until he was\n",
      "well punished, and glad when released to rush from that neighborhood. Female\n",
      "âpetâ deer, and female elk, can and do put up dan- gerous fights with their\n",
      "front hoofs, standing high up on their hind legs and striking fast and\n",
      "furiously. A gentleman of my acquaintance was thus attacked, most unexpectedly,\n",
      "by his pet white-tailed deer doe. She struck about a dozen times for his breast,\n",
      "and his vest and coat were slit open in several places. I once saw two cow elk\n",
      "engage with their front feet in a hot fight, but they did no real damage. Of\n",
      "course an angry bison, buffalo or gaur lowers its head in attacking a man, and\n",
      "seeks to gore and toss him at the same moment. The American bison will start at\n",
      "a distance of ten or twenty yards, and with half lowered head jump forward,\n",
      "grunting âUh! Uh! Uh!â as he comes. When close up he pauses for a second and\n",
      "poises his head for the toss. That is the manâs one chance. At that instant he\n",
      "must strike the animal on the side of his head, and strike hard; and the region\n",
      "of the eye is the spot at which to aim. Once we were greatly frightened by the\n",
      "determined charge of a savage cow bison upon Keeper McEnroe, who was armed with\n",
      "a short-handled 4-tine pitchfork. As she grunted and came for him we could not\n",
      "refrain from shouting a terrorized warning, âLook out, McEnroe! Look out!â\n",
      "He looked out. He stood perfectly still, and calmly awaited the onset. The cow\n",
      "rushed close up, and dropped her chin low down for the goring toss. The keeper\n",
      "was ready for her. Swinging his pitchfork he delivered a smashing blow upon the\n",
      "left side of the cowâs head, which disconcerted and checked her. Before she\n",
      "could recover herself he smashed her again, and again. Then she turned tail and\n",
      "ran, followed by the shouts of the multitude. Adult male elephants are among the\n",
      "most dangerous of all wild animals to keep in captivity. They will grow bad-\n",
      "tempered with adult age, keepers will become careless of danger that is present\n",
      "every day, and a bad elephant often is a cun- ning and deceitful devil. The\n",
      "strength of an elephant is so great, the toughness of its hide is so pronounced,\n",
      "and the danger of a sudden attack is so permanent that life in a park with a\n",
      "âbadâ elephant is one continuous nightmare. Naturally we have been ambitious\n",
      "to prevent all manner of fatal wild beast attacks upon our keepers. We try our\n",
      "best to provide for their safety, and having done that to the limit we say:\n",
      "âNow it is up to you to preserve your own life. If you can not save yourself\n",
      "from your bad animals, no other person can do it for you!â Either positively,\n",
      "comparatively or superlatively, a bad elephant is a cunning, treacherous and\n",
      "dangerous animal. We have seen several elephants in various stages of\n",
      "cussedness. Alice, the adult Indian female, is mentally a freak, but she is not\n",
      "vicious save under one peculiar combination of circum- stances. Take her outside\n",
      "her yard, and instantly she becomes a storm centre. Gunda was bad to begin with,\n",
      "worse in con- tinuation and murderously worst at his finish. At present Kartoum\n",
      "is dangerous only to inanimate fences and doors. A wild elephant attacks a\n",
      "hunter by charging furiously and persistently, sometimes making a real\n",
      "man-chase, seizing the man or knocking him down, and then impaling him upon his\n",
      "tusks as he lies. More than one hunter has been knocked down, and escaped the\n",
      "impalement thrust only through the mercy of heaven that caused the tusks to miss\n",
      "him and expend their murderous fury in the ample earth. On rare occasions an\n",
      "enraged wild elephant deliberately tramples a man to death; and there is one\n",
      "instance on record wherein the elephant held his dead native victim firmly to\n",
      "the ground while he tore him asunder âand actually jerked his arms and legs to\n",
      "some distance.â In captivity a mean elephant kills a keeper, or other person,\n",
      "by suddenly knocking him down, and then either trampling upon him or impaling\n",
      "him. Gunda, our big male Indian tusker, was the worst elephant with which I ever\n",
      "came in close touch, and we hope never to see his like again. When about ten\n",
      "years old he came to us direct from Assam, and when I saw his big and bulging\n",
      "eyes, and the slits torn in his ears, I recognized him as a bad-tempered animal.\n",
      "I kept my opinions to myself. Two weeks later when we started Gundaâs Hindu\n",
      "keeper back toward his native land, I sent for Keepers Gleason and Forester to\n",
      "give them a choice lot of instruction in elephant management. They heard me\n",
      "through attentively, and then Forester said very solemnly: âDirector, I think\n",
      "that is a bad elephant; and Iâm afraid of him!â Keeper Gleason willingly\n",
      "took him over, on condition that he should have sole charge of him, and as long\n",
      "as Gleason remained in our service he managed the elephant successfully.\n",
      "Elsewhere I have spoken at length of Gundaâs mind anc manners. He went\n",
      "steadily from bad to worse; but we nevei once really punished him. The time was\n",
      "when there was on!} one man in the world whom he feared, and would obey, anc\n",

      "yelled at him, anc: admonished him to behave himself. But all that ended on the:\n",

      "he took it. With a fierce sidewise thrust of his head he struck his keeper1\n",
      "squarely on the shoulder and sent him plunging to the fioor in the stall corner\n",
      "nearest him. Then, instantly he wheeled! about and started to follow up his\n",

      "plant his feet soi that they would do execution. Then he tried to kneel upon the\n",

      "tried hard to pull himself into the refuse box, through its low door; but with\n",

      "passage and in about ten secondsâ arrived in front of Gundaâs cage. And\n",
      "there was Gunda, killing Walter Thuman. Richards darted in between the\n",

      "which prevented further accidents, but finally Gunda became a hopeless case of\n",
      "sexual insanity and lust for murder. When Gunda became most dangerous, we\n",
      "protected our keepers by chaining his feet, and keeping the men out of the reach\n",

      "the âChronic Carrier.â J.âINTRODUCTION. For many years the causes of\n",
      "epidemics of enteric fever were supposed to be either (1) infection by water,\n",
      "(2) infection by food, or (3) infection by contact. Infection by water or food\n",
      "produces a morbidity curve characterized by a sudden rise, the sharper and more\n",
      "elevated according as the pollution has been more abundant. When, however,\n",
      "infection depends on contact, the prevalence shows a curve only slightly\n",
      "elevated and often prolonged over many months. The importance of contact\n",
      "infection was not realized until Koch commenced his researches in 1901. Repeated\n",
      "outbreaks of enteric fever had occurred in Westphalia, and in some parts of the\n",
      "Rhine province the disease had become endemic. The German Government accordingly\n",
      "called upon Koch to conduct an enquiry and to advise as to the measures to be\n",
      "taken to combat the disease. Experiments having shown that the life of the\n",
      "typhoid bacillus outside the human body is comparatively shortâprobably not\n",
      "more than one month in water and two months in soilâKoch came to the\n",
      "conclusion that the human body, either suffering from enteric fever or\n",
      "convalescent from it, is the starting point of all typhoid infection, and\n",
      "pointed out the necessity of preventing contact infection, in other words, of\n",
      "searching for and isolating the human host of the bacillus. Frosch, Donitz and\n",
      "others, working in south-west Germany, proved the danger due to contact\n",
      "infection. They were puzzled, however, by the constant occurrence of enteric\n",
      "fever in a house, the so- ealled ââ typhoid house,â which had hitherto\n",
      "been free from infection. In explanation of this occurrence Frosch suggested the\n",
      "possibility of a prolonged or indefinite excretion- by a convalescent patient,\n",
      "but it was left to Conradi, Kayser and their collaborators to demonstrate the\n",
      "existence of the chronic âtyphoid carrier.â Kayser collected 101 cases of\n",
      "cured typhoid fever cases declared to be free from typhoid bacilli, and yet at a\n",
      "period of two years after convalescence three cases were found to be still\n",
      "harbouring the bacillus, and were therefore chronic carriers. More recent work\n",
      "has confirmed these vbservations, and it may be taken as established that about\n",
      "3 to 4 per cent. of convalescents from enteric fever become chronic carriers,\n",
      "and that in the neighbourhood of enteric cases a small percentage of the\n",
      "community may be temporary harbourers of the bacillus. It has also been noted\n",
      "that chronic carriers excrete the typhoid bacillus in an intermittent fashion,\n",
      "and in certain cases several months of intermission have been observed. The\n",
      "results of the German investigations have been received with great interest\n",
      "everywhere, and especially in India, where in spite of the provision of a pure\n",
      "water supply, enteric fever has remained endemic in many stations. In 1906 the\n",
      "Government of India appointed a committee to investigate the channels by which\n",
      "enteric fever is propagated. In 1907 the committee stated âit has been proved\n",
      "that a proportion of those who have suffered from enteric fever, either in a\n",
      "form recognized as such or so slightly as to escape recognition, and of those\n",
      "who have been in close contact with them, harbour and excrete typhoid bacilli\n",
      "for considerable periods while showing no symptoms of illness.â They\n",
      "recommended that â accommodation should be provided in the hills for isolating\n",
      "convalescents from enteric fever away from other troops. The places selected for\n",
      "this purpose must have at their command bacteriological laboratories where\n",
      "cultivations from the excreta can be made daily, to determine when the\n",
      "individuals are free from infection.â Naini Tal DepÃ©t was reserved for\n",
      "convalescents from enteric fever, and during 1908 several chronic carriers were\n",
      "detected and subsequently invalided to England. In France the question of the\n",
      "bacillus carrier has been carefully studied, and it is now ordered: (1) That\n",
      "typhoid fever cases shall be kept in hospital until a bacterio- logical\n",
      "examination of the stools and urine has shown that the B. typhosus is absent\n",
      "from these excreta ; and (2) that every soldier returning to his corps from\n",

      "Group (1). In the pure intestinal cases it was thought that it might be possible\n",
      "to disinfect the gastro-intestinal tract by the aid of lactic acid bacilli.\n",
      "Professor Elie Metchnikoff, of the Paris Pasteur Institute, and his pupil\n",
      "Cohendy, have recently directed attention âto the remarkable therapeutical\n",
      "effects obtained by the use of certain lactic acid producing organisms\n",
      "administered in the form of curdled milk or in malt extract. The action of these\n",
      "lactic acid germs has been shown to be strongly inimical to the organisms of\n",
      "cholera, dysentery and infantile diarrhoea. The idea of treating typhoid\n",
      "carriers with lactic acid bacilli also occurred to Professor Drigalski, who, in\n",
      "conjunction with Professor Fraenkel, has carried out observations on two cases\n",
      "with apparently successful results. : The Advisory Board Sub-committee arranged\n",
      "that two carriers, Gunner C. and Private H., should be treated on these lines.\n",
      "Groups (2), (3) and (4). In cases where the typhoid bacillus has invaded the\n",
      "urinary tract it appears unlikely that the administration of lactic acid bacilli\n",
      "will prove beneficial, as when given by the mouth they do not appear to be\n",
      "excreted by the urinary passages. Cases complicated by symptoms of inflammation\n",
      "of the gall bladder are also unfavourable for the lactic acid treatment. Recent\n",
      "work in Germany on this class of ease has shown that the typhoid bacilli may\n",
      "gain access to the gall bladder in three ways: (1) by passage from the small\n",
      "intestine, (2) by passage from the liver by the hepatic duct, and (8) by direct\n",
      "passage from the capillaries of the gall bladder itself. It appears also that\n",
      "when the typhoid bacillus has invaded the gall bladder changes go on in its\n",
      "walls, which become thickened, covered with fringe-like processes, and lose\n",
      "their epithelial lining. The typhoid bacilli are found in the midst of necrotic\n",
      "areas in the thickened tissues; in course of time they are set free by the death\n",
      "of the altered tissues, and gaining access to the bile probably multiply there,\n",
      "as that fluid forms a favourable medium for their growth. It is evident that\n",
      "though the lactic acid bacilli in the intestine might also reach the gall\n",
      "bladder, they would only prove effective against the bacilli floating in the\n",
      "bile. They could not be expected to influence the bacilli enclosed in the\n",
      "necrotic areas in the _walls of the gall bladder. Under these circumstances the\n",
      "Germans have suggested =&lt; that the gall bladder should be removed, and this\n",
      "has been done with success in certain * cases. Such an operation should be\n",
      "performed only as a last resource, and the committee thought that before\n",
      "considering such an heroic procedure an attempt should be made to cure these\n",
      "cases by calling in the aid of the protective substances, which naturally exist\n",
      "in the human body and can be increased in amount by the injection of a suitable\n",
      "vaccine. It was accordingly decided to commence the treatment of cases in groups\n",
      "(2), {3) and (4) by injecting gradually increasing doses of anti-typhoid\n",
      "vaccine. At first the general vaccine, prepared in the Royal Army Medical\n",
      "College, was employed. This vaccine has proved a very effective prophylactic for\n",
      "enteric fever, and has also given encouraging results when employed for the\n",
      "treatment of the disease. But though the injection of the vaccine has increased\n",
      "the protective substances in the patients, the excretion of typhoid bacilli has\n",
      "not been arrested. It appears that races of typhoid bacilli, probably in\n",
      "relation to their virulence, show marked variation in their resistanceâ to the\n",
      "action of the protecting substances, and if the best results are to be obtained\n",
      "vaccines made from the infecting bacilli in each case must be employed. Instead\n",
      "of a general vaccine, specific vaccines are now being used, and it is hoped that\n",
      "through their agency the excretion of the typhoid bacilli may be completely\n",

      "OF THE FIVE â CARRIER CASESâ NOW IN MILLBANK HOSPITAL. (a) Treatment by\n",
      "cultures of lactic acid bacillr. - The cases in group (1), Private H. and Gunner\n",
      "C., have been treated by this method. Before the treatment was commenced careful\n",
      "enumerations were made of the numbers of B. coli and B. typhosus in the stools.\n",
      "A pure culture of Metchnikoffâs Bulgarian bacillus was isolated from\n",
      "Lacto-bacilline powder and then grown in a diluted extract of malt for 48 hours\n",
      "at 37Â° Â©. At first only 25 Â¢.c. of the 48 hoursâ culture were given daily\n",
      "to each patient, later the amount was increased to 250 cc. daily divided into\n",
      "three doses. Extract of malt, instead of milk, was selected for the medium, as\n",
      "one of the investigators found by personal experience, that the exhibition of\n",
      "considerable quantities of acid milk gave rise to some irritation of the\n",
      "stomach. The faeces were carefully examined from time to time so as to determine\n",
      "when the Bulgarian bacillus had become established in the alimentary canal.\n",
      "Experiments were also carried out in vitro to determine after what period of\n",
      "growth of the lactic acid bacilli the toxins produced by them would destroy the\n",
      "typhoid bacillus. It was found that the toxins produced in 48 hours sufficed to\n",
      "destroy the strain of B. typhosus excreted by Private H., but in the case of\n",
      "Gunner C. the bacilli required to be grown for five days before the toxins\n",
      "destroyed the infecting organism. These observations have a practical bearing on\n",
      "the results obtained. Case of Private H.âA reference to Chart I shows that\n",
      "this man was excreting 3,200,000 typhoid bacilli in each gramme of faeces before\n",
      "the treatment was begun. On March 8th, 25 cc. of the malt culture were given,\n",
      "but the Bulgarian bacillus was not established in the alimentary canal until\n",
      "March 26th. This long interval was probably due to the small dose of the\n",
      "Bulgarian bacilli given, and in future it would be well to avoid this long delay\n",
      "by giving large doses at once, as was done by Cohendy, under Metchnikoffâs\n",
      "direction, without any harm resulting. On April 2nd, the excretion of typhoid\n",
      "bacilli rose to 28,000,000 per gramme of stool, and the chart shows very clearly\n",
      "that though the excretion of typhoid bacilli was continuous the numbers varied\n",
      "extremely. At the end of April the typhoid bacilli disappeared from the faeces,\n",
      "and no signs of them have been discovered up to the present date. It is hoped\n",
      "that this patient is cured, but the treatment must be stopped and the patient\n",
      "must be kept under observation for a few weeks before the real result can be\n",
      "ascertained. Gunner C.âChart II shows that this man was excreting 190,090,000\n",
      "typhoid bacilli per gramme of stool when first examined, and though the\n",
      "treatment with Bulgarian bacilli was carried out exactly as in the case of\n",
      "Private H. no cure has resulted. The Bulgarian bacilli are well established in\n",
      "his alimentary canal, and yet at the last examination he was still found to be\n",
      "excreting 86,000,000 bacilli per gramme. The explanation of this disappointing\n",
      "result is to be found in the resistance which the infecting organism shows to\n",
      "the toxins of the lactic acid bacillus. As already stated the accumulated toxins\n",
      "produced by five daysâ growth of the lactic acid bacilli in vitro were\n",
      "required to destroy the stram of B. typhosus which had infected this man.\n",
      "Unfortunately the lactic acid culture has a slightly aperient affect, and it\n",
      "appears probable that the toxins are discharged from the bowel before the\n",
      "desired effect has been produced on the typhoid bacillus. (b) Treatment by\n",
