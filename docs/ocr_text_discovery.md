# OCR Text Discovery Roadmap

Below is a structured overview of how We might enable thematic/concept browsing over the OCR’d texts of ~200,000 books in the Wellcome Collection, by building and enriching a knowledge graph and combining it with vector-based semantic search. Each section includes techniques, tools, and considerations, with citations to relevant literature or guides.

---

## 1. Introduction & Goals

We have ~200,000 OCR’d books whose full text is available but currently searchable only on a per-book basis. We want:

- **Theme/Concept pages**: e.g., pages for “tuberculosis,” “public health,” “women’s health,” “anatomy,” etc., surfaced automatically or semi-automatically from the corpus.
- **Knowledge graph (KG)**: extracted entities (people, diseases, places, treatments, concepts) and their relationships from across the corpus, linked and enriched (e.g., to external vocabularies or ontologies).
- **Semantic search**: chunked text embedded into vector indices for retrieval of relevant passages across books, to complement KG-driven browsing.
- **Integrated UI/UX**: users browse themes/concepts via the KG (showing linked entities, related works, timeline views, etc.), or search semantically across all texts.

Key high-level steps:

1. **Data ingestion & preprocessing**: clean OCR text, normalize.
2. **Entity extraction & linking**: named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking (EL) to internal/external ontologies (e.g., UMLS/MeSH/Wikidata).
3. **Relation extraction**: identify relationships between entities within and across documents.
4. **Knowledge graph construction**: model entities & relations in a graph database or triple store; integrate metadata (book metadata: author, date, subjects).
5. **Theme/concept identification & enrichment**: derive theme nodes automatically (e.g., via clustering, topic modeling, or frequent entity co-occurrence) or curate seed lists; connect them in graph.
6. **Semantic search index**: chunk texts into passages, embed with sentence/document embedding models; index in vector store.
7. **Integration & UI**: combine KG browsing and semantic search in front-end, enabling users to explore themes, drill into related entities, retrieve passages or books semantically.
8. **Evaluation & iteration**: assess coverage, relevance, usability; refine pipelines (NER models, linking accuracy, embedding models, UI flows).

Each of these is detailed below.

## 2. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

### 2.1 OCR Text Cleaning

- **OCR errors**: Historical books often have OCR noise: misrecognized characters, archaic spellings.  
- **Normalization**:
  - **Spell correction / normalization**: Optionally run historical spelling normalization or modernized spell-check, depending on use case. For entity extraction, preserving original form may help link historical terms; but normalization can improve NER/EL accuracy. A hybrid approach: keep raw text but also generate normalized text for processing.
  - **Noise removal**: Remove page headers/footers, line numbers, garbled sections. Wellcome’s OCR metadata might include zones or confidence scores; use those to filter out very low-confidence text or mark uncertain segments.
- **Segmentation**:
  - **Chunking into passages**: Decide chunk size for embedding/indexing. Common practice: paragraph-level chunks or sliding windows of ~100-300 tokens, possibly overlapping slightly to avoid cutting entities.  
  - **Document-level segmentation**: For KG extraction, sentence-level or paragraph-level extraction is common: run sentence segmentation (with NLP libraries that handle historical text if possible).
- **Metadata ingestion**:
  - Gather bibliographic metadata (title, author, publication date, subject headings if present). This metadata is crucial to link extracted entities to the source works, to support filtering by date or author in browsing.

*Citations:* General pipelines for large-scale text preprocessing and OCR cleanup are described in various semantic search guides and corpora processing literature.

## 3. Entity Extraction & Linking

Central to building a KG is recognizing entity mentions in text and linking them to canonical identifiers.

### 3.1 Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- **Pre-trained models**: Off-the-shelf NER (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face transformers) may recognize generic entities (PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE). However, for historical medical texts, domain-specific entities (diseases, treatments, anatomical parts, historical terms) require specialized models.
- **Domain adaptation**:
  - Fine-tune or use biomedical NER models (e.g., BioBERT-based NER). Models like BioBERT or UmlsBERT (which incorporate UMLS knowledge) can help identify biomedical entities more accurately  [oai_citation:1‡arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10391?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
  - Historical language: consider training or fine-tuning on annotated historical medical corpora if available; otherwise, accept some drop in recall/precision or apply post-correction.
- **Custom/Niche entities**: We may need to recognize entities like medical instruments, philosophical concepts, archaic disease names. Develop custom NER using:
  - **Rule-based gazetteers/dictionaries**: build lists of known terms (e.g., from UMLS, MeSH, historical medical lexicons) to aid recognition.
  - **Weak supervision**: use patterns or dictionary matches to bootstrap labeling for training.
  - **Active learning**: sample segments, annotate, and iteratively refine model.

### 3.2 Entity Linking (EL) / Normalization

- **External knowledge bases**:
  - **Biomedical vocabularies**: UMLS Metathesaurus, MeSH, SNOMED CT. Link disease/treatment mentions to UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) or MeSH IDs. This enables unifying synonyms (e.g., “consumption” → tuberculosis).  
  - **General KBs**: Wikidata or DBpedia for persons, places, organizations, events.
- **Biomedical entity linking**: Survey of biomedical EL methods indicates complexity (ambiguity, abbreviations)  [oai_citation:2‡link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-023-01144-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Techniques:
  - **Dictionary-based/linking**: QuickUMLS or similar for candidate generation, then disambiguation via context embeddings.
  - **ML-based approaches**: Use deep learning EL models that combine mention context embeddings with entity embeddings from KB; e.g. NeighBERT-like architectures for medical EL  [oai_citation:3‡link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41666-023-00136-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Disambiguation challenges**: Historical term ambiguity: some terms may have changed meaning. Consider:
  - Time-aware linking: link to historical concept when possible. If external KB lacks historical variant, may need to create internal representations or map approximate.
  - Confidence scoring: store linking confidence; uncertain links can be flagged for manual review or lower weight in KG.

### 3.3 Relation Extraction

- **Objective**: Identify relationships between recognized entities within sentences/paragraphs (e.g., disease–treatment, author–work, concept–related concept).
- **Techniques**:
  - **Rule-based / pattern-based**: For some relations (e.g., “treated with,” “caused by”), build patterns. Useful for domain-specific relations (e.g., “X was used to treat Y”).
  - **Supervised relation extraction**: If We can annotate or have small labeled datasets, fine-tune relation extraction models (e.g., transformer-based classifiers) to detect relation types.
  - **Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)**: Extract generic triples (subject, predicate, object) from sentences; then map predicates to a controlled vocabulary or relation types where possible. This can yield many noisy relations but helps seed the graph.
  - **LLM-assisted extraction**: With modern LLMs, We can prompt to extract relations, though at scale We need careful batching and cost considerations.
- **Normalization of relations**: Map extracted relation phrases to a set of canonical relation types (e.g., “treats,” “causes,” “associated_with,” “located_in,” “authored_by,” etc.). Use ontology or schema design to define allowed relation types in Wer KG.

## 4. Knowledge Graph Construction

### 4.1 Schema/Model Design

- **Entity types (node labels)**: e.g., `Book`, `Person`, `Place`, `Disease`, `Treatment`, `AnatomicalPart`, `Concept`, `Organization`, `Event`, etc. Also `Theme` nodes as higher-level groupings.
- **Relation types (edge labels)**: e.g., `MENTIONED_IN`, `AUTHOR_OF`, `PUBLISHED_IN_YEAR`, `TREATED_WITH`, `CAUSES`, `ASSOCIATED_WITH`, `LOCATED_IN`, `INFLUENCED_BY`, etc. Define a core ontology/schema suitable for medical/historical context.
- **Properties**: Store metadata on nodes/edges: e.g., for `Book`, store title, author, publication date, language, OCR confidence metrics; for `Entity` nodes, store canonical ID (e.g., UMLS CUI or Wikidata QID), label, source vocabulary; for edges, store provenance (which book, which sentence/paragraph) and confidence scores.

### 4.2 Graph Database / Storage

- **Options**:
  - **Property graph DB**: e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune (with property graph API), JanusGraph. Neo4j is popular and has good tooling for ingestion, querying, visualization.  [oai_citation:6‡go.neo4j.com](https://go.neo4j.com/rs/710-RRC-335/images/Building-Knowledge-Graphs-Practitioner%27s-Guide-OReilly-book.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
  - **RDF triple store**: if We prefer semantic web standards (RDF/SPARQL/OWL), e.g., Blazegraph, Virtuoso. Use RDF if interoperability with Linked Open Data is a priority.
- **Ingestion**:
  - Batch import: generate CSV/JSON files of nodes and relationships; use bulk import tools (Neo4j’s bulk import, or RDF loaders).
  - Streaming updates: if new books or corrections arrive, design incremental pipelines to process new OCR text, extract entities/relations, and update the KG.

### 4.3 Enrichment with External Data

- **Linking**: As above, linking entities to UMLS, MeSH, Wikidata. For each linked entity, We can import additional attributes: definitions, synonyms, hierarchical relations (e.g., MeSH tree), which enrich theme pages.
- **Ontology integration**: Import relevant portions of external ontologies (e.g., MeSH hierarchy) into Wer graph, so that “pneumonia” is a subtype of “respiratory tract infections,” which in turn is under “communicable diseases.” This helps browsing by hierarchical themes.
- **Temporal/spatial data**: For historical works, extract publication dates; for events or mentions, extract temporal expressions to support timeline views. For places, geocode (link to GeoNames or Wikidata for coordinates) to support map-based browsing.
- **Bibliographic linkage**: Link authors to authority files (e.g., VIAF or Wikidata) to unify author nodes across books.
- **Provenance & provenance graph**: Track which extraction method produced each node/edge, with confidence. This allows filtering or weighting relationships (e.g., only show high-confidence relations on public UI, or mark tentative ones).

---

## 5. Theme / Concept Identification

### 5.1 Manual Seed Lists & Curation

- **Subject experts** can define initial themes of high interest (e.g., “cholera,” “mental health,” “women’s suffrage and health”), using domain knowledge to select key terms or UMLS concepts.  
- **Seed nodes**: For each theme, identify corresponding canonical entity nodes in KG (e.g., UMLS CUI for “cholera”). Then expand via graph traversal to related entities (e.g., treatments, locations, years) to populate the theme page.

### 5.2 Automatic Theme Discovery

- **Topic modeling**: Run unsupervised topic models (e.g., LDA) or more modern approaches (e.g., BERTopic which uses embeddings + clustering) on the corpus to surface clusters of documents/chunks. Each cluster can be examined to define a theme.  
  - Topic models help identify recurring themes across books; We can map these clusters to KG nodes by linking top terms or representative entity mentions.
- **Entity co-occurrence clustering**: In the KG, find communities/clusters of entities that frequently co-occur across books (e.g., via graph clustering algorithms). Each cluster may represent a theme (e.g., “cholera outbreaks in 19th century Europe” linking disease, places, dates, authors).  
- **Hybrid**: Combine topic modeling and entity clustering: first derive candidate topics, then map to entity clusters for more structured representation.
- **User behavior signals**: If We have search logs, see which terms/users search often, and identify emergent themes.  
- **Iterative refinement**: Present suggested themes to domain experts for labeling or refinement.

### 5.3 Representing Themes in the KG

- **Theme nodes**: Create nodes of type `Theme` or `ConceptPage`. Link them to:
  - **Canonical entity nodes**: e.g., theme “tuberculosis” links to entity node `Disease:Tuberculosis`.
  - **Related entities**: e.g., for “tuberculosis,” link to treatment entities, locations where studied, key authors, time periods.
  - **Representative books/passages**: Link to book nodes with high relevance (e.g., many mentions, strong embedding similarity).
- **Properties**: For theme nodes, store:
  - **Description**: auto-generated summary (see Section 7).
  - **Representative keywords / synonyms**.
  - **Hierarchy**: parent themes (e.g., “Infectious diseases” → “Tuberculosis”).
  - **Popularity metrics**: number of linked books/passages, user interest.
- **Graph relationships**:
  - `THEME_INCLUDES`: theme → entity or theme → book.
  - `RELATED_THEME`: theme ↔ theme edges (e.g., “cholera” related to “public health policy”).
  - Use relation weights (e.g., frequency-based or confidence) to rank related entities.

## 6. Semantic Search via Chunking & Embeddings

### 6.1 Chunking Strategy

- **Unit of retrieval**: Typically paragraph-level or sliding-window of ~100-300 tokens, overlapping by e.g. 50 tokens to capture context.  
- **Metadata linkage**: Each chunk carries metadata: book ID, page number (if available), paragraph offset, date, etc.  
- **Preprocessing before embedding**: Clean text (remove boilerplate), possibly normalize archaic spelling for embedding accuracy.

### 6.2 Embedding Models

- **Choice of model**:
  - **General-purpose models**: Sentence Transformers (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic similarity  [oai_citation:7‡sbert.net](https://www.sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  
  - **Domain-specific embeddings**: Biomedical sentence embeddings (e.g., BioSentVec, BioBERT embeddings, or fine-tuned Sentence Transformers on biomedical corpora). Fine-tuning on domain text often yields better retrieval for medical queries.
  - **Historical text considerations**: If embedding model trained on modern text, archaic language might reduce quality; possible to fine-tune further on a subset of OCR text to adapt embeddings.
- **Embedding dimension & performance**: Balance between embedding size (e.g., 384-768 dims) and vector store capacity/performance.

### 6.3 Vector Indexing & Search

- **Vector store choices**:
  - **Open-source**: FAISS, Annoy, Milvus, etc.
  - **Managed/Cloud**: Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.
- **Indexing**:
  - Bulk index all chunk embeddings.  
  - Optionally, partition index by language or time period if needed for efficiency or specific UI filters (e.g., only search within 19th-century books).
- **Search pipeline**:
  - **Query embedding**: Embed user query using same model.  
  - **Nearest neighbor search**: Retrieve top-k chunks similar to query.
  - **Filtering by metadata**: Combine vector scores with filters (e.g., restrict to certain date ranges, languages, types). This can be done by re-ranking: first retrieve candidates via vector search, then filter by metadata; or use hybrid indexes (some vector stores support metadata filtering).
  - **Hybrid search**: Combine keyword-based search (Elasticsearch or similar) with vector search: e.g., retrieve candidates by keyword, then re-rank by vector similarity, or vice versa.
- **Relevance tuning**:
  - Evaluate retrieval quality via test queries and relevance judgments.
  - Fine-tune embedding models or adjust retrieval thresholds.

## 7. Generating or Enriching Theme Page Content

Once We have KG nodes representing themes and vector index for passages, We can auto-generate or assist curation of theme pages:

### 7.1 Summarization & Descriptions

- **Auto-generated summaries**: For each theme node, compile:
  - **Definition**: Pull from linked external ontology (e.g., UMLS definition for a disease).  
  - **Corpus-derived summary**: Use extractive summarization over representative passages: pick top-n chunks (by embedding similarity to theme entity) and extract key sentences; or use abstractive summarization (with caution for factual accuracy).  
- **Citations & provenance**: Show users which books/passages support the summary, linking back to source.

### 7.2 Representative Passages & Snippets

- **Semantic retrieval**: For a theme, run vector search with theme terms or embeddings of theme entity to retrieve top passages across books. Display snippets as examples.
- **Filter by sub-themes**: If theme has sub-concepts (e.g., for “cholera”: “John Snow,” “water supply,” “London 1854”), allow filtering of passages by these sub-concepts.

### 7.3 Related Entities & Subtopics

- **Graph neighbors**: For a theme node, list related entities (from KG edges) ranked by edge weight or frequency. For “tuberculosis,” show treatments, affected organs, key historical figures, geographical hotspots, time periods.
- **Interactive graph visualization**: Show a small network graph around the theme for exploration, letting users click on related entity nodes to navigate.
- **Hierarchical navigation**: If ontology/hierarchy is imported (e.g., MeSH tree), allow browsing parent or child topics.

### 7.4 Linked Works & Further Reading

- **Books/articles list**: From KG, list book nodes where theme entity is mentioned frequently or significantly; possibly rank by relevance (frequency of mentions, embedding similarity, publication date). Include metadata: title, author, date, short description.
- **Faceted filtering**: Allow filtering results by publication date range, author, location, language, type (e.g., monograph vs. pamphlet).
- **Access links**: For each work, link to book page, show availability (digital copy link, reading room request info).

### 7.5 Timeline & Geospatial Views

- **Temporal distribution**: Using publication dates or context of mentions, present a timeline chart showing how discussion of the theme evolves over time (e.g., a spike in “cholera” mentions during certain decades).  
- **Geographic mapping**: If places mentioned are geocoded, show a map of where the theme was significant (e.g., outbreaks location, places of study).

### 7.6 User Contributions & Feedback

- **Bookmarking & annotations**: Let users bookmark theme pages, annotate passages, or suggest corrections to entity links (crowdsourcing improved linking).  
- **Feedback loop**: Collect user feedback on relevance of passages or related entities to refine KG weighting or embedding tuning.

---

## 8. Integration: Combining KG Browsing & Semantic Search

A cohesive UI/UX integrates:

- **Search bar**: Accepts free-text queries; behind the scenes, perform semantic search (vector) and keyword search, present results with metadata, and highlight entity mentions. Offer “Did We mean?” suggestions via KG (e.g., if user types “consumption,” suggest linking to “tuberculosis”).
- **Entity autocomplete**: As user types, suggest entities from KG (e.g., if user types “chol…,” suggest “Cholera” with info).  
- **Theme portal**: A landing page listing major themes (curated + discovered), perhaps organized by broad categories (e.g., Infectious Diseases, Anatomy, Public Health). Clicking a theme opens the theme page as in Section 7.
- **Browse by ontology**: If We imported MeSH hierarchy, provide a tree widget to navigate subject headings, where each heading links to a theme page.
- **Graph exploration**: An interactive graph viewer for advanced users to explore entity relationships; clicking nodes shows details and allows drilling into related theme pages or semantic search results.
- **Hybrid search results**: If a user searches a broad query, show a mix of:
  - **Theme suggestions**: “It seems We might want to explore these themes: X, Y, Z.”
  - **Top passages**: semantic search hits from books.
  - **Related entities**: from KG.  
- **Contextual filters**: When viewing search results or theme pages, allow filtering via KG facets: e.g., show only works where the theme is discussed in relation to a certain time period or place.
- **APIs**: Expose an API for programmatic access: allow external tools (e.g., digital humanities projects) to query KG and semantic index.

---

## 9. Infrastructure & Scalability

### 9.1 Processing Pipeline

- **Distributed processing**: 200k books × large text. Use distributed frameworks (Apache Spark, or cloud-based serverless functions) for scaling NLP steps (NER/EL/relation extraction). Alternatively, batch jobs on a cluster.
- **Incremental updates**: As new OCR texts or corrections arrive, process only new/changed items and update KG and vector index incrementally.
- **Storage**:
  - **Text storage**: Raw and cleaned text stored in blob storage or object store.
  - **Embeddings & vector index**: Use a vector store that supports large-scale indexing and fast nearest-neighbor queries. Consider sharding or partitioning if necessary.
  - **KG database**: Choose a scalable graph database or RDF store; consider clustering or cloud-managed service.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Track success/failure of NLP jobs, monitor index health, usage metrics, query latencies.
- **Model serving**: If using ML models (NER, EL, embedding), deploy via scalable inference service (e.g., containerized microservices, GPU clusters for heavy models).
- **Cost considerations**: Balance model complexity vs. throughput. For embedding, lightweight models (e.g., smaller Sentence Transformers) may suffice for many queries.

### 9.2 Technologies & Tools

- **NLP frameworks**: spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers for NER; domain-specific models (BioBERT, UmlsBERT).  
- **Entity linking tools**: QuickUMLS; custom EL pipelines with candidate generation + disambiguation.  
- **Relation extraction**: OpenIE libraries; transformer-based relation classifiers; LLM APIs (with cost/scale caution).  
- **Graph DB**: Neo4j (property graph), possibly with APOC for advanced graph algorithms; or RDF triple store if SPARQL suits integration goals.  
- **Vector store**: FAISS (self-hosted) or managed services (Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search.  
- **Indexing & search engine**: Optionally combine with Elasticsearch for metadata/keyword search, integrated with vector search via hybrid approach.  
- **Frontend frameworks**: Web app framework (React, Vue) to build interactive theme pages, graph visualizations (e.g., D3.js, Neo4j Bloom embedding).  
- **APIs & microservices**: Expose endpoints for search, KG queries, embedding inference.  
- **Orchestration**: Airflow or similar for scheduling NLP ingestion pipelines.

## 10. Evaluation & Iteration

### 10.1 KG Quality

- **Entity/linking accuracy**: Sample random mentions; check precision/recall of NER and EL. Use manually annotated ground truth for critical entity types.  
- **Relation correctness**: Evaluate extracted relations against a small gold set or via expert review.  
- **Coverage**: Check what proportion of important concepts are captured. Identify missing areas (e.g., some diseases or terms not recognized due to archaic spelling).

### 10.2 Search Relevance

- **Semantic search evaluation**: Prepare test queries representing user intents (e.g., “early treatments for tuberculosis,” “mental health in Victorian era”) with known relevant passages. Measure retrieval metrics (precision@k, recall).  
- **User testing**: Conduct usability testing with representative users (researchers, educators, casual browsers, digital humanists) to assess if theme browsing and search meet their needs.  
- **A/B testing UI changes**: Test different ways of surfacing themes (e.g., recommended themes on home page) to see what yields engagement.

### 10.3 Theme Page Usefulness

- **Expert review**: Domain experts review auto-generated theme pages for accuracy and completeness.  
- **User feedback loops**: Allow users to flag missing related entities or irrelevant suggestions; refine graph weights or extraction rules accordingly.

### 10.4 Continuous Improvement

- **Retrain/refine models**: As We collect more annotated data (from corrections or feedback), retrain NER/EL models to improve accuracy, especially for historical terms.  
- **Expand external KBs**: Integrate additional ontologies or local glossaries for archaic terminology.  
- **Refine theme algorithms**: Adjust clustering or topic modeling parameters; update seed lists as new interests emerge.  
- **Logging & analytics**: Monitor which theme pages or searches are most used, where users drop off, and iteratively refine.

---

## 11. Challenges & Considerations

### 11.1 OCR & Historical Language

- **Inaccuracy**: OCR errors reduce NER/EL accuracy; consider manual correction for high-value texts or using OCR post-correction tools.  
- **Archaic spelling/terminology**: Many historical medical terms may not match modern vocabularies. Need custom lexicons or historical language models.

### 11.2 Entity Ambiguity & Disambiguation

- **Ambiguous names**: Person names might refer to multiple historical figures; context (publication date, co-occurring entities) must guide linking.  
- **Term drift**: Some terms had different meanings historically; linking to modern KBs may misrepresent. Consider creating “historical concept” nodes when needed.

### 11.3 Relation Extraction Noise

- **Noisy triples**: OpenIE can generate many low-quality relations; need filtering and normalization.  
- **Complex relations**: Some relations (e.g., causal or temporal sequences) are subtle and may require specialized models or manual curation.

### 11.4 Scalability

- **Compute cost**: Processing 200k books at sentence-level extraction and embedding is resource-intensive. Use distributed processing, batch scheduling, and optimize models for throughput.  
- **Storage & retrieval performance**: Graph databases can become large; plan for indexing strategies, caching, and possibly sharding. Vector indexes need efficient nearest-neighbor search solutions.

### 11.5 UI/UX for Diverse Audiences

- **Different user expertise**: Researchers vs. casual users need different entry points. Provide both simple search and advanced graph exploration.  
- **Avoid overwhelming**: Graph visualizations must be constrained (show limited neighborhood) to prevent overload.  
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI meets accessibility standards (screen reader compatibility, clear labeling).

### 11.6 Data Privacy & Licensing

- **Public domain vs. restricted texts**: Although OCR’d texts may be public domain or licensed, ensure any display of passages respects copyright where applicable.  
- **User data**: If collecting usage data or annotations, ensure privacy compliance.

## 14. Domain-Specific Considerations for Wellcome Collection

Because this corpus is medical/historical:

- **Use UMLS/MeSH integration**: Map diseases, anatomical parts, treatments to UMLS or MeSH IDs for consistent concept pages. For historical variants (e.g., archaic disease names), maintain alias lists linked to UMLS or internal historical concept nodes.  [oai_citation:10‡link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-023-01144-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Temporal anchoring**: Many medical concepts evolve; track temporal context. E.g., “consumption” historically refers to tuberculosis; create mapping to modern concept but note historical usage period.
- **Ethical/sensitive content**: Some content may describe distressing medical practices; theme pages should include contextual framing.
- **Scholarly metadata**: Leverage existing catalog metadata (e.g., subject headings, classification codes) in KG to bootstrap entity linking.
- **Collaboration with domain experts**: Engage historians of medicine or librarians to validate theme definitions and entity mappings.

## 15. Evaluation & User Testing

- **User personas**: Test with researchers, educators, casual users, digital humanists.
- **Task-based evaluation**: E.g., “Find passages on 19th-century smallpox vaccination arguments” – measure if user can locate relevant materials more easily than before.
- **Usability studies**: Observe how users navigate theme pages; whether they understand graph visualizations; if semantic search returns intuitive results.
- **Relevance feedback**: Collect ratings on top semantic search results and related entity suggestions; use feedback to refine retrieval ranking or KG weights.
- **Performance metrics**: Query latency, index update times, graph query performance; monitor and optimize.

## 16. Iteration & Maintenance

- **Pipeline monitoring**: Automated alerts on pipeline failures; logging for NLP jobs (e.g., number of texts processed, errors).
- **KG versioning**: Keep track of KG updates; allow rollback if problematic ingestion; maintain provenance metadata.
- **Model retraining**: Periodically retrain or fine-tune NER/EL models as new annotated data or improved methods become available.
- **User feedback loop**: Provide UI affordances for users to suggest corrections (e.g., flag wrong entity links or missing synonyms).
- **Scalability planning**: As more texts are OCR’d/added, ensure pipelines can scale; consider cloud auto-scaling for heavy NLP jobs.
- **Documentation & APIs**: Maintain clear documentation of KG schema, API endpoints for search/KG queries, so external developers (digital humanities community) can build on Wer system.

## 18. Summary

By combining NLP pipelines (NER, EL, relation extraction), a graph database to house entities/relations + metadata, and a semantic vector search index over chunked OCR text, We can transform per-book search into a rich thematic browsing experience:

- **Knowledge Graph** drives concept/theme pages: users navigate via entities, see related concepts, timeline and spatial context, and lists of works.
- **Semantic Search** lets users retrieve relevant passages across all books even when keyword search fails due to archaic language or varied phrasing.
- **Integration** of KG and search (e.g., thematic suggestions, entity autocomplete, hybrid re-ranking) provides a unified UX.
- **Scalability & evaluation**: use distributed processing for large-scale NLP; continuously evaluate with domain experts and user testing to refine accuracy and usability.
- **Domain adaptation**: leverage UMLS/MeSH for medical concepts, address historical term variation, and ensure sensitive content is properly contextualized.

This approach turns the OCR’d texts into a rich, interconnected resource, enabling users (researchers, educators, casual visitors, digital humanists) to discover and explore themes in ways not possible with per-book search alone.
